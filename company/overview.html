            <h1>Overview</h1>
                        
            <p>Tipbox's financial strategy is designed to bring together the company's innovative business model, growth potential and investors' expectations in a professional and balanced manner. The company's financial road map is clearly defined, covering all critical areas from investment rounds to fund utilization, from partnership structure to exit strategies.</p>
            
            <p>The financial statements presented have been prepared as of the Seed investment round, during which Tipbox will achieve a product capable of generating revenue and a solid user base. In this context, the funds obtained from the Pre-Seed investment round are used for the development of the product, preparations for market entry and building the initial user base. Therefore, financial projections begin only after the platform reaches a state where it can generate active income streams.</p>
            
            <p>Tipbox attaches great importance to timing sensitivity in its investment strategy and does not take token-based investments unconsciously or uncontrollably. The platform does not conduct token sales; instead, they are only listed on reputable and highly liquid exchanges so that the tokens are accessible to users in interactions within the platform. This strategy ensures that investors are protected from speculative movements and that the TIPS token is traded in a stable and healthy market environment in the long term.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, the ecosystem fund has a high share in Tipbox's financial approach (40%). This fund is used to create strong incentive mechanisms and sustainable reward systems that center users. The ecosystem fund allows the platform to overcome the problem of early stage financial sustainability ("valley of death"), which is critical for startups, by being supported by resources derived from revenue models and mechanisms such as token buybacks. With this approach, Tipbox aims to create sustainable value for both users and investors, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial success.</p>
            
            <p>The company's corporate financing begins with Pre-Seed, Seed and Seed Extension investment rounds, which support controlled growth from the initial stage, and then continues with a strong Series-A investment round. Thanks to the hybrid valuation method, both the advantages of the token economy and the stability and reliability provided by traditional capital investments create a unique and attractive value for investors.</p>
            
            <p>Tipbox's partnership structure is built on a balanced share distribution, with strong representation of the founders and the core team. Dilutions that occur with new investor entries are managed with professional mechanisms such as preemptive rights to protect the shares of the founding partners and ensure investor confidence. In addition, share classes created for different investor profiles ensure transparency and managerial stability by clearly defining the rights and powers of investors in company management.</p>
            
            <p>The capital obtained as a result of investment rounds is effectively managed to support the operational growth of the platform, accelerate user acquisition and strengthen its competitive advantage in the market. In this context, financial projections clearly show the company's transformation from the controlled investment and growth phase in the early years to a profitable and sustainable financial structure in the following periods.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, Tipbox has determined professional and realistic exit strategies in order to maximize the value increase that its investors will obtain from their capital investments. Various exit methods such as IPO, strategic acquisition and secondary market sales are designed to be flexible enough to adapt to different expectations of investors and market conditions.</p>
            
            <p>Tipbox aims to create a strong and sustainable financial future by blending company finance with professional management approaches, transparency and investor-oriented strategies.</p>
