            <h1>User Behavior Flow and Conversion Expectations</h1>
            
            <p>Tipbox's user acquisition and contribution processes are modeled through a five-stage funnel structure in line with the platform model based on product-function structure and content economy.</p>
            
            <p>Each phase is structured by taking into account early growth targets, similar platform benchmarks, user interaction trends and first-year operational targets.</p>
            
            <p>This structure includes not only the number of users; It is also based on the quality of behavior, content contribution intensity and levels of economic participation. Conversion rates are defined to be optimized in line with product positioning and incentive strategies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Infographic-2</strong></p>
            
            <p>Funnel and conversion rates are modeled separately for each user segment and detailed with internal metrics. However, these forecast models and segment-based conversion data are not shared publicly due to company policies. The models in question will be offered to interested investors within the framework of a confidentiality agreement only in investment processes that have reached a certain maturity.</p>
            
            <h2>Revenue Optimization</h2>
            
            <p>Tipbox uses its early-stage revenue growth strategies not only to increase the number of users; by deepening product usage motivations in certain segments <strong>It is based on strengthening contribution-oriented income behaviors.</strong> For this purpose, micro incentive structures integrated into the product architecture are applied in a targeted manner to specific user groups. Below are just some examples of these strategies:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Special Badges for Consumer Electronics Enthusiasts:</strong></p>
            
            <p>Users who share content about new products and receive the most contributions are offered badges and content highlighting privileges that increase their visibility in the category. These users are also included in the Premium Lite trial access periodically.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Prime Pass Gift for Premium Plan Users:</strong></p>
            
            <p>Prime Pass is assigned to the first 1,000 users who purchase one of the Premium plans in the early period in order to increase their in-platform interactions. This strategy both supports subscription conversion and activates token-based spending.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Advantage of Standing Out with 'Trends':</strong></p>
            
            <p>Various categories of fields such as Cosmetics and Consumer Electronics are periodically determined as 'Trends'. The content of users who ask questions/highlight posts in trending areas becomes more visible. These trending contents have advantages such as token recovery for the user.</p>
            
            <p>This structure enables direct alignment of in-platform engagement strategies with segment-based user habits. There are many other similar strategies that increase contribution motivation, trigger payment behavior, and support both direct and indirect revenue streams in specific segments.</p>
            
            <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> In this section, only sample applications are included. The entire strategy set and detailed segment-based optimization scenarios are evaluated within the scope of internal strategic documentation and will be shared with investors upon request within the framework of the confidentiality policy.</em></p>
