            <h1>KPI's & Success Metrics</h1>
            
            <p>Tipbox's growth strategy is defined not only by user acquisition, but also by the quality of contribution behavior and the depth of economic interaction. In this context, the platform's success is tracked not only through numerical growth, but also through multi-layered performance indicators such as revenue generation per user, contribution continuity, content support volume and subscription conversions.</p>
            
            <p>This section describes the key performance indicators (KPIs), value-per-user metrics (CLTV, ARPU, etc.) and the OKR structure based on strategic goals, each of which is structured in a way that is directly linked to the product functioning and revenue model.</p>

            <h2>Metric Definitions</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>\( \text{CLTV} = F_{avg} \times M \)</strong>
                    <br>User's average monthly spending Ã— average usage time (months)</li>
                <li><strong>\( \text{ARPU} = G_{total} / U_{total} \)</strong>
                    <br>Total monthly revenue / total number of active users</li>
                <li><strong>\( \text{ARPPU} = G_{payer} / U_{payer} \)</strong>
                    <br>Average revenue per revenue generating user</li>
                <li><strong>\( \text{CAC} = M_{marketing} / U_{earned} \)</strong>
                    <br>Total marketing expenditure for new user acquisition / number of new users</li>

            <h2>OKR Structure (Objectives & Key Results)</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Objective 1: Deepening user contribution and making content production sustainable.</strong></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The rate of contributing users should reach 40%.</li>
                <li>25% of users who made their first contribution must contribute again within 30 days.</li>
                <li>At least 15% of producer users must be supported by the community at least once.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Objective 2: Growing the revenue-generating user base and activating the economic cycle</strong></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>1,000 Prime Passes should be sold in the first phase.</li>
                <li>The conversion rate from free users to Premium should increase to 7.5%.</li>
                <li>Monthly token spending volume must exceed the $10,000 threshold.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Objective 3: Increase long-term profitability by optimizing revenue generation per user</strong></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The CLTV average should rise above the $45 level.</li>
                <li>The platform's overall ARPU must be a minimum of $2.5.</li>
                <li>CAC value should not exceed 30% of CLTV.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>All metrics in this section are predictive values prepared in line with the platform's early-stage strategy. Conversion rates, user contribution behavior and revenue generation models are projected based on product positioning, funnel structure and market entry strategies. The measurement systematic will be updated and maintained over time through testing, iteration and segment-based user analysis.</p>
