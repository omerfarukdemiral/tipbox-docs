            <h1>Market Overview</h1>
            
            <h2>Overview of Target Markets</h2>
            
            <p>In the field of digital content and interaction, three basic structures have come to the fore in recent years:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Web2 based social networks,</li>
                <li>Community platforms with Web3 integration</li>
                <li>Product/service review platforms.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Tipbox is positioned as a new model that combines the advantages of these three structures while also overcoming their limitations.</p>
            
            <h3>Web2 Based Social Networks</h3>
            
            <p>Web2 platforms (Instagram, Reddit, etc.) make it easier for users to create and interact with content.</p>
            
            <p>However, these structures have some basic limitations:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of verification:</strong> The reliability of experiences cannot be measured.</li>
                <li><strong>Content purposelessness:</strong> The contents are unstructured and lack context.</li>
                <li><strong>Discoverability problem:</strong> Valuable content quickly loses visibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Superficial interaction:</strong> The capacity to establish deep connections and create information chains is limited.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Web2 platforms emphasize sociality; However, it is inadequate in terms of content reliability and information architecture.</p>
            
            <h3>Web3-Integrated Community Platforms</h3>
            
            <p>Web3 platforms offer values ​​such as transparency, ownership and decentralization. However, it has difficulty meeting users' expectations in the context of content and experience sharing:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complex user experience:</strong> Technical barriers raise the entry threshold for a wide range of users.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of content:</strong> Since platforms focus on the economic model rather than social structure, content production remains limited.</li>
                <li><strong>Community isolation:</strong> The high technical barrier limits natural social interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Low availability:</strong> There is an adaptation problem in developing markets.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Web3 platforms prioritize transparency and ownership; however, it falls short of connecting the user to the content and community.</p>
            
            <h3>Product/Service Review Platforms</h3>
            
            <p>Review-focused platforms such as Trustpilot and Foursquare make it easier to access information. However, aspects such as establishing social connections, creating interaction and highlighting the content creator are limited:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of social context:</strong> It is not clear who the comments are coming from or why they are valuable.</li>
                <li><strong>Categorical limitation:</strong> The contents are mostly superficial and limited to singular examples.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of interaction:</strong> It is not possible to establish a connection between users.</li>
                <li><strong>Content lifetime is short:</strong> Comments whose value decreases over time are not recirculated within the system.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Review platforms offer trust; but it does not make the user visible and does not create community impact.</p>
            
            <p>Tipbox's business model in these three markets can be roughly shown as the table below;</p>
            
            <img src="/img/market/2.png" alt="Product/Service Review Platforms">

            
            <p>In summary, Tipbox combines the strengths of these three structures:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>the sociality of Web2,</li>
                <li>The transparency of Web3,</li>
                <li>It integrates the knowledge-oriented structure of evaluation platforms in a single experience environment.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>At the same time, it redefines the missing aspects between these structures:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Curated content,</li>
                <li>Segment based sharing,</li>
                <li>Economically motivated community dynamics,</li>
                <li>It offers a design language that increases accessibility while maintaining digital trust.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Strategic Market Choices and Sectoral Focuses in the Early Phases</h2>
            
            <p>In line with its strategic growth and market expansion targets, Tipbox focuses primarily on the cosmetics, consumer electronics and digital services sectors in the startup and early stage stages. These sectors attract attention with their high growth potential, increasing consumer demands and frequency of online reviews.</p>
            
            <p>Especially fast moving consumer goods in many sectors constitute a significant part of consumer demands. Harvard Business School professor <a href="https://professionalprograms.mit.edu/blog/design/why-95-of-new-products-miss-the-mark-and-how-yours-can-avoid-the-same-fate/">According to Clayton Christensen</a> 95% of new products that enter the shelves fail and production cannot be continued. So much so that, according to BoltInsight, 80% of new products lose their presence on the shelves within 24 months. This situation includes product development, brand creation, sales and marketing strategies development, etc. by understanding the consumer and consumer demands. It demonstrates the importance of sensitivity in many professional approaches.</p>
            
            <p>Tipbox aims to serve consumers with a focus on understanding users, increase its market share and strengthen its position in the industry by providing solutions based on reliable and verified experiences of users in the fields of cosmetics, consumer electronics and digital services. The company's current market plan and road map requires deepening in these focus sectors early on, and the potential to expand into other sectors in the future has been strategically planned.</p>
            
            <h3>Cosmetics Industry</h3>
            
            <p>The cosmetics industry, in which female consumers are particularly involved, is gaining increasing popularity in the global market. Consumer interest in beauty and care products has led to the rapid adoption of new trends and technologies. This increase in demand drives consumer behavior, especially through social media and digital platforms.</p>
            
            <p>The cosmetics industry is expected to reach $800 billion by 2026, according to data confirmed by Phoenix Chemicals. This growth is accelerated by increasing consumer demand, new product innovations and digital marketing strategies. Consumers are becoming increasingly conscious and inquisitive when purchasing cosmetics. Product reviews and user experiences, especially on online platforms, greatly influence their purchasing decisions. According to research, 74% of consumers read online reviews and user comments before purchasing cosmetics (<a href="https://www.styleseat.com/blog/beauty-industry-statistics/">StyleSeat</a>). This increases the need for verified experiences of users.</p>
            
            <p><em>Since the cosmetics industry is a sector that can quickly adapt to constant innovations and consumer demands, and where users become more investigative day by day, Tipbox; It recognized users' need for verified experiences in the cosmetics industry and the high impact of online reviews on purchasing decisions in the analysis results and included it in its preferred markets in the early period.

            <h3>Consumer Electronics Industry</h3>
            
            <p>The consumer electronics sector is a dynamic market that is constantly growing with interest in technology and innovation. In this sector, consumers' adaptation to fast-changing technology and the search for innovation keeps the market constantly moving, and according to <a href="https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/consumer-electronics-market">Global Market Insights</a>, by 2023, the global consumer electronics market is valued at $1.1 trillion and is expected to grow to $1.4 trillion by 2026\. This growth is driven by technological innovation, increasing consumer demand and digital transformation. According to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/consumer-markets/consumer-insights-survey.html">PwC's 2023 report</a>, 78% of consumers consider online reviews and user comments before purchasing electronic products. This clearly shows the impact of online reviews and user comments on consumer behavior.</p>
            
            <p><em>Since the consumer electronics industry is an area where high-budget purchases are common and users have a high need to access reliable information, Tipbox has identified this market as a priority; It has adopted a strategic choice to focus on this sector at an early stage in order to increase the accuracy and reliability of user experiences.</em></p>
            
            <h3>Digital Services Sector</h3>
            
            <p>The digital services sector is a rapidly expanding market for users and businesses, especially in line with the ever-changing technology dynamics of today's world. In recent years, online subscription and cloud services have gained tremendous momentum in digital services. In fact, by 2023, the value of the global digital services market reached $600 billion and is expected to grow to $850 billion by 2026\. (<a href="https://bango.com/how-telcos-must-capitalize-on-the-super-bundling-opportunity/">Bango</a>) Also, according to the 2023 report published in <a href="https://www.itpro.com/cloud/public-cloud/369434/gartner-public-cloud-spending-reach-nearly-600-billion-in-2023">ITPro</a>, 65% of global digital services are offered through online platforms. Accordingly, consumers are more conscious and inquisitive when choosing digital services. Reliable and verified user experiences are of great importance, especially on online platforms. According to<a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/customer-service-in-2023-cx-front-and-center/">Forrester</a>'s 2023 report, 70% of users avoid making decisions about digital services without detailed user comments and reviews. This shows that user experiences and detailed reviews will become increasingly important in the digital services industry.</p>
            
            <p><em>As the digital services industry is a sector that can quickly adapt to rapidly changing technology dynamics and users' ever-increasing service expectations, Tipbox has focused on this market early on because, despite being a billion-dollar industry, online reviews of digital services are scarce and users have a high need for verified experiences in this area.</em></p>
