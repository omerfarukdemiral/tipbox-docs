            <h1>FOCUS PROBLEMS</h1>
            
            <p>In the modern digital world, users face various difficulties in accessing reliable information about products and services, sharing their experiences, and obtaining added value from their sharing. As a result of focus group discussions and field studies with more than 150 individual participants, TIPBOX identified the root causes of these problems and conducted comprehensive research and analysis on their intensity and frequency.</p>
            
            <p>The studies revealed that users struggle with basic issues such as difficulty in identification, lack of interaction, lack of added value, lack of trust, and lack of systematic standards.</p>
            
            <p>To clarify the priority areas on which TIPBOX will focus and to demonstrate its potential, these problems were categorized into two groups: major problems and minor problems. While major problems have a direct and comprehensive impact on users' experience-sharing processes, minor problems represent the complementary features and supporting elements of the platform.</p>
            
            <p>TIPBOX aims to provide effective and sustainable solutions to the following key problems by combining the social interaction power of Web2 with the incentive mechanisms of Web3:</p>
            
            <h2>Major Problems</h2>
            
            <h4>1. Confusion and Reliability Issues in Experience Sharing</h4>
            
            <p>The experiences shared by users on existing social media platforms, forums, and e-commerce sites are often unstructured, lacking context, and difficult to interpret. Since it is unclear under what circumstances and in which contexts these experiences are shared, users hesitate to trust the accuracy and reliability of the information.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Lack of Control over the Accuracy and Quality of Experiences</h4>
            
            <p>It is difficult to verify the accuracy and quality of user-generated content on traditional platforms. Comments and evaluations can be manipulated, making it harder for users to access reliable information. This leads to incorrect assessments and decisions during the purchasing and usage processes.</p>
            
            <h4>3. Lack of Mechanisms to Encourage User Participation and Content Creation</h4>
            
            <p>Most platforms do not offer tangible or meaningful rewards to motivate users to share experiences. When users do not gain material or moral benefits from their contributions, their motivation to share decreases, weakening their commitment to the platform.</p>
            
            <h2>Minor Problems</h2>
            
            <h4>1. Lack of Visibility for User Expertise and Experiences</h4>
            
            <p>On existing platforms, it is not possible to assess how knowledgeable or reliable a user is in specific subject areas. As a result, users have difficulty finding others with relevant experience or similar interests and miss out on personalized recommendations.</p>
            
            <h4>2. The Economic Value of Users' Contributions Goes Unrecognized</h4>
            
            <p>Large digital platforms and brands leverage user-generated content and data to create economic value but rarely share that value with the users. This prevents users from realizing the true worth of their content and limits the growth of the sharing economy by reducing motivation to contribute.</p>
            
            <h4>3. AI Systems Operate on Inefficient and Low-Quality Data</h4>
            
            <p>Content on current platforms tends to be unstructured, disorderly, and devoid of context. This reduces the accuracy and reliability of AI-supported analysis and recommendation systems. As a result, users often mistrust the suggestions offered by these systems, weakening the effectiveness of digital decision-making tools.</p>
            
            <h2>TIPBOX's Focus</h2>
            
            <p>TIPBOX's primary focus is to solve individual users' problems related to experience sharing and to create both social and economic value by encouraging interaction. In the long term, structured and verified data sets shared by users also have the potential to support product development processes, marketing activities, and market analyses by offering strategic insights to business partners and brands. These opportunities will always be evaluated in accordance with user data privacy and data sovereignty principles.</p>
