            <h3>Token Structure and Economic Cycle</h3>
            
            <p>The TIPS Token Structure lies at the heart of the economic cycle that powers the sustainability of the Tipbox platform. Users earn TIPS by sharing experiences, creating content, commenting, and engaging in social interactions on the platform. These earned TIPS are then spent by users to unlock various features and privileges within the ecosystem.</p>
            
            <p>TIPS tokens that are spent by users re-enter the platform economy by funding new reward pools, which are then redistributed to the community. This creates a constantly renewing, dynamic, and sustainable economic cycle.</p>
            
            <p>This structure encourages users to participate both socially and economically, supporting long-term growth by continuously increasing the utility and perceived value of the Tipbox token economy.</p>
