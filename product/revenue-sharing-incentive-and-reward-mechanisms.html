            <h1>REVENUE SHARING, INCENTIVE AND REWARD MECHANISMS</h1>
            
            <p>The core economic model of the TIPBOX platform is a comprehensive and innovative revenue-sharing system in which all revenues are distributed fairly and transparently between users and the platform. This model aims to maintain high levels of user engagement and ensure the platform's sustainable growth by rewarding users based on their performance.</p>
            
            <p>TIPBOX offers dedicated revenue-sharing and incentive structures for different user types: Basic Users, Premium Users, and Creator Users.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Basic Users</h3>
            
            <p>Basic users can benefit from economic incentives as long as they remain active on the platform. By performing actions such as content creation, writing reviews, commenting, and interacting, they progress along the Achievement Ladder and earn various NFT badges. Each NFT badge is linked to a dedicated reward pool, and all users holding that badge receive an equal share from the pool. Additionally, users with high performance (based on follower count, interaction rate, etc.) can receive extra economic incentives.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Premium Users</h3>
            
            <p>Premium users can access TIPBOX's economic and social advantages more comprehensively. With unlimited NFT badge slots and faster progression on the Achievement Ladder, Premium users can earn from multiple badges simultaneously. Although reward distribution rates are the same as for Basic Users, Premium Users can claim rewards more frequently and with higher efficiency, increasing their total economic earnings.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Creator Users</h3>
            
            <p>Creator users are positioned at the center of TIPBOX's economic structure. This group benefits directly from the platform's overall revenue share pool, which is distributed based on performance. Supported by special incentives, creator users earn economic value through two primary mechanisms: Revenue Sharing from the Platform, Direct Tipping by Users.</p>
            
            <h2>Economic Incentives and Rewards for Users</h2>
            
            <p>TIPBOX implements various reward and incentive mechanisms to turn user activity into tangible earnings, boost participation, and maintain the health of the platform's economic cycle. These mechanisms help new users adapt quickly while assigning direct economic value to contributions made by active participants.</p>
            
            <h3>Initial Incentives for New Users</h3>
            
            <p>Special incentive programs such as BOX101 and WARMUP Bonuses help new users and creators adapt quickly by granting immediate economic value upon joining the platform.</p>
            
            <h3>NFT Badges and Rewards Linked to Achievements</h3>
            
            <p>Users earn NFT badges by completing achievement ladders tied to platform activities. Initially launched in cosmetics, digital services, and consumer electronics sectors, the badge system will expand over time to maintain interest and ensure continuous engagement.</p>
            
            <h3>User Invitation Rewards with Affiliate Program</h3>
            
            <p>TIPBOX users earn bonus TIPS by bringing in new users through their personal referral links. This structure supports community-driven growth and incentivizes organic expansion.</p>
            
            <h3>Catalog Development and Approved Content Contribution Awards</h3>
            
            <p>Users who add new products or services to the TIPBOX catalog — following the platform's content format and templates — are rewarded with bonus TIPS once their content is approved by the editorial team. This enriches the platform's data and turns users into active information contributors.</p>
            
            <h2>Creator Program and Revenue Sharing Details</h2>
            
            <p>The Creator Program is specifically designed for users who are at the heart of the platform's content ecosystem and community management. Creators play a critical role in TIPBOX's sustainable growth and in strengthening its community-building processes.</p>
            
            <h3>Special Badge</h3>
            
            <p>Digital badges specially designed for creators make it easy to identify them within the platform. These badges enhance the credibility and social prestige of creator content, increasing overall user engagement and stimulating economic activity.</p>
            
            <h3>Tipping and Special Content Wall</h3>
            
            <p>This is one of the most important tools enabling creators to turn their content into economic value. Users can directly tip creators using TIPS Tokens to access content or receive one-on-one support. Creators can also build private content walls, granting exclusive access to certain posts only for tipping users — creating a steady stream of income.</p>
            
            <h3>Community Group for Tippers</h3>
            
            <p>Users who tip creators gain access to private chat groups. These exclusive spaces allow special communities to form around creators, increasing user loyalty and deepening engagement with the platform.</p>
            
            <p>Thanks to these features, creators do more than produce content — they build communities, improve content quality, and convert interaction into economic value. The Creator Program plays a crucial role in ensuring the platform's long-term economic growth.</p>
            
            <h3>Creator Community Tipping System</h3>
            
            <p>Creator users earn income from the tips sent by users who want to join their communities. The initial platform commission rate on these tips is 15%; however, as a creator's influence and level increase over time, this rate is gradually reduced to 5%. These rates are highly advantageous and creator-friendly compared to similar platforms in the industry.</p>
            
            <h3>Creator Revenue Sharing Pool</h3>
            
            <p>The TIPBOX platform maintains a shared revenue pool generated from TIPBOX Premium, TIPBOX Prime Pass sales, cosmetic item purchases, transaction fees, and other platform revenues. A portion of this pool is periodically distributed to creators based on performance. Revenue sharing is carried out transparently and securely through blockchain technology and smart contracts.</p>
            
            <h2>Strategic Advantages of Revenue Sharing</h2>
            
            <p>The TIPBOX revenue sharing model provides several strategic advantages for both investors and users. These advantages contribute directly to increased user loyalty, the encouragement of organic and high-quality content production, and the platform's sustainable economic growth. The platform's low commission rates and transparent, blockchain-based infrastructure help maintain high levels of user trust, which in turn increases long-term user commitment to the platform. In summary, TIPBOX adopts a strategic revenue-sharing model that transforms users' social interactions and content into economic value while ensuring the overall economic sustainability of the platform. Revenue generated from users' economic activity on the platform is shared fairly and transparently. This structure continuously incentivizes user participation and supports long-term economic growth and loyalty within the ecosystem.</p>
            
            <h2>Prize Pool and Distribution Models in Revenue Sharing</h2>
            
            <p>TIPBOX implements a holistic revenue-sharing model designed to distribute the economic value generated through user and creator interactions in a transparent, performance-based, and sustainable way.</p>
            
            <p>One of the foundational principles of this system is that users' social, contextual, and economic contributions are supported by quantitative measurements. The mathematical models developed for this purpose play a critical role not only in calculating reward distributions but also in monitoring the behaviors that influence these distributions and in dynamically optimizing the incentive systems.</p>
            
            <p>The formulas presented in this section provide the systematic basis for TIPBOX's revenue-sharing process. Some formulas are used directly in the distribution calculations (e.g., NFT-badge reward pool share or creator revenue rates), while others function as control variables, feeding the logic of the system through their indirect effects (e.g., user engagement score or vesting rate).</p>
            
            <p>Our goal is to make the platform's economic mechanisms intuitive, mathematically consistent, and auditable.</p>
            
            <p>Thanks to these models, TIPBOX offers a fair, transparent, and measurable economic incentive structure for both users and creators. At the same time, it builds a data-driven infrastructure optimized for the long-term stability and growth potential of the platform.</p>
            
            <h3>Metrics and Mathematical Model Setups</h3>
            
            <h4>Total Platform Revenue</h4>
            
            <p>The total revenue generated as a result of user interactions and in-platform transactions on the TIPBOX platform is one of the most essential metrics for measuring the system's sustainability. This revenue represents the sum of values collected from various sources and is used to assess the overall scale of the platform economy.</p>
            <div>$$R_{total} = R_{trx} + R_{nft} + R_{premium} + R_{tips} + R_{other}$$</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>R<sub>trx</sub></strong>: Total revenue earned from transaction fees on the platform</li>
                <li><strong>R<sub>nft</sub></strong>: Revenue earned from cosmetic NFT sales</li>
                <li><strong>R<sub>premium</sub></strong>: Revenue earned from premium plan subscriptions</li>
                <li><strong>R<sub>tips</sub></strong>: Revenue earned from TIPS sales</li>
                <li><strong>R<sub>other</sub></strong>: Additional revenue from sponsorships, partnerships, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It also serves as the starting point for calculating prize pools and creator funds to be distributed. All reward pools, creator payments, and the platform's development budget are allocated based on this total value. Since the weights of these revenue components may change over time, the formula is designed to be modular and scalable.</p>
            
            <h4>Periodic Average Token Price</h4>
            
            <p>All economic distributions, user incentives, and creator payments on TIPBOX are based on the value of TIPS. However, relying solely on the current market price may cause imbalances or potential manipulation due to short-term price fluctuations. To address this, TIPBOX uses a reference pricing model where the current price is dominant, but the average price over a past period helps stabilize calculations. This periodic average price smooths out temporary volatility and supports fairer distribution calculations.</p>
            
            <p>The average price is calculated as follows:</p>
            
            <div>$$P_{avg} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{T} P_i}{T}$$</div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>P<sub>i</sub></strong>: The TIPS price taken at each measurement period (e.g., hourly, 6-hourly)</li>
                <li><strong>T</strong>: Total time period to average (e.g., last 24 hours)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Then this value is evaluated together with the instant market price (<em>P<sub>instant</sub></em>) to create a reference price:</p>
            
            <div>$$P_{ref} = 0.75 \cdot P_{instant} + 0.25 \cdot P_{avg}$$</div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>P<sub>ref</sub></strong>: Final reference token price used in distributions and calculations</li>
                <li><strong>P<sub>instant</sub></strong>: Real market price at the time of transaction</li>
                <li><strong>P<sub>avg</sub></strong>: Past period average price calculated above</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This system provides real-time price sensitivity while maintaining stability against short-term fluctuations, creating a safer and more predictable economic foundation for TIPBOX users and creators.</p>
            
            <h4>User Prestige & Interaction Rate</h4>
            
            <p>In TIPBOX, a user's social impact is evaluated not only by the quantity of interactions but also by the consistency, trustworthiness, and diversity of their contributions. Accordingly, a user's relative interaction strength is assessed through a combination of direct feedback (such as likes, comments, and tips), comparisons with other users, behavioral patterns over time, and overall community contribution.</p>
            
            <p>The system calculates a user's overall engagement rate based on the volume and type of interactions they receive. This metric is used to align reward systems with actual performance, determine user visibility in rankings, and inform platform-wide incentive strategies. The Raw Engagement Score represents the weighted sum of all direct interactions with a user's content. TIPBOX currently measures four key types of social response.</p>
            <div>$$E_{raw} = \alpha \cdot LikesReceived + \beta \cdot CommentsReceived + \gamma \cdot SharesReceived + \delta \cdot TipsReceived$$</div>
            <p>Parameter Explanations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LikesReceived</strong>: Total number of likes received on the user's content</li>
                <li><strong>CommentsReceived</strong>: Total number of comments made on the user's content</li>
                <li><strong>SharesReceived</strong>: Number of times the user's content has been shared by other users</li>
                <li><strong>TipsReceived</strong>: Total number of tips received by the user (as a numerical action)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Contribution Score measures a user's long-term value to the community. It goes beyond short-term social interactions by assessing factors such as the user's trust level, their contribution to knowledge creation, and their effectiveness in bringing new users to the platform.</p>
            <div>$$C_{value} = \epsilon \cdot TrusterCount + \zeta \cdot NFTCount + \eta \cdot ActiveTracks + \theta \cdot AffiliateUsers$$</div>
            <p>Parameter Explanations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TrusterCount</strong>: Number of other users who have marked this user as trustworthy</li>
                <li><strong>NFTCount</strong>: Number of NFT badges owned by the user</li>
                <li><strong>ActiveTracks</strong>: Number of achievement ladders the user is actively progressing on</li>
                <li><strong>AffiliateUsers</strong>: Number of users invited and activated through the user's affiliate link</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Time and Activity Normalizing Component: Scores are normalized over time to prevent system abuse and manipulative behavior. While producing more content and maintaining longer activity increases the score, it also slows down the rate of score acceleration — ensuring fair and balanced growth.</p>
            <div>$$D_{stabilize} = \sqrt{ActiveDays \cdot log(TotalPosts + 1)}$$</div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ActiveDays</strong>: Total number of days the user has been active on the platform</li>
                <li><strong>TotalPosts</strong>: Total number of content posts published by the user</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>And so the unnormalized score;</p>
            
            <div>$$U^{raw}_{engagement} = \frac{E_{raw} + C_{value}}{D_{stabilize}}$$</div>
            
            <p>Expressed as: Ultimately, the Relative Engagement Score is calculated by comparing an individual's score to the average of all users, resulting in a percentage-based relative value.</p>
            
            <div>$$U^{\%}_{engagement} = \frac{U^{raw}_{engagement}}{\overline{U^{raw}_{engagement}}} \cdot 100$$</div>
            
            <p>This metric evaluates a user's overall contribution to the platform. Being recognized and valued by others serves as a core indicator. The volume of feedback a user receives directly impacts their social prestige, credibility, and priority within reward systems. Additionally, the resulting interaction score is used in processes such as NFT badge reward distribution and the prioritization of one-on-one support requests.</p>
            
            <h4>Creator Vesting Rate</h4>
            
            <p>The TIPBOX platform applies a special vesting mechanism within its token economy to ensure that the creator revenue-sharing fund is managed in a transparent, controlled, and sustainable way. The vesting rate determines how many tokens are released from the creator fund over a given time period. This approach protects the system against manipulation and prevents sudden depletion by distributing the total volume of tokens gradually over time.</p>
            
            <p>The following model represents the basic linear vesting structure, which maintains platform economy balance while ensuring long-term continuity.</p>
            
            <div>$$V_{creator}(t) = \frac{AllocatedTokens_{unlocked}(t)}{AllocatedTokens_{total}}$$</div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AllocatedTokens<sub>unlocked</sub>(t)</strong>: Total amount of tokens unlocked until time t</li>
                <li><strong>AllocatedTokens<sub>total</sub></strong>: Total amount of tokens allocated for the creator program</li>
                <li><strong>V<sub>creator</sub>(t)</strong>: Total vesting ratio at a given time (a value between 0-1)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Alternatively, logarithmic vesting can be used for a more balanced expansion pattern:</p>
            
            <div>$$V_{creator}(t) = log\left(1 + \frac{t}{T_{total}}\right)$$</div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>t</strong>: Elapsed time</li>
                <li><strong>T<sub>total</sub></strong>: Total vesting period (e.g., 12 months)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This second model encourages patient and sustained contributions from creators by starting with a slower release rate that accelerates over time.</p>
            
            <p>While this vesting mechanism ensures that creators' earnings become permanent, it also keeps the platform's token supply under control and helps maintain market balance. Moreover, it serves as one of the platform's most important trust mechanisms, demonstrating to investors that the revenue-sharing process is conducted in a strategic and well-governed manner.</p>
            
            <h4>NFT-Badge Prize Pool Distribution</h4>
            
            <p>On TIPBOX, users earn NFT badges by completing achievement ladders through their platform activities. Each NFT badge is connected to a reward pool funded by platform revenues, and only users who hold that specific badge are eligible to access its pool.</p>
            
            <p>The distribution of rewards is handled through a hybrid system that balances equity with performance-based differentiation among users.</p>
            
            <p>The distribution formula consists of two core components:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Equal distribution (base prize)</li>
                <li>Performance-based additional rewards</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>A user's total earnings are calculated as the sum of these two layers.</p>
            
            <div>$$H_{final,i} = \frac{(H_{total} \cdot 0.50)}{N} + \left(\frac{U_{engagement,i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} U_{engagement,j}}\right) \cdot (H_{total} \cdot 0.50)$$</div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>H<sub>total</sub></strong>: Total amount of TIPS in the NFT-badge reward pool</li>
                <li><strong>N</strong>: Total number of users who earned the badge</li>
                <li><strong>U<sub>engagement,i</sub></strong>: Normalized engagement score of user i</li>
                <li><strong>∑U<sub>engagement</sub></strong>: Sum of engagement scores of all badge holders</li>
                <li><strong>H<sub>final,i</sub></strong>: Total TIPS reward that user i will receive from this badge</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The first component of this model — a fixed 50% distribution — ensures the accessibility of the badge system by encouraging broad-based participation. The remaining 50% is distributed based on each user's actual interaction strength on the platform, directly rewarding those who contribute more.</p>
            
            <p>In this way, the system offers rewards to passive participants while placing greater emphasis on encouraging active and high-impact users.</p>
            
            <h4>Dynamic Revenue Sharing for Creators</h4>
            
            <p>On TIPBOX, creator users receive a direct share from the revenue-sharing pool based on the value they contribute to the platform. However, this share is not fixed; it is dynamically calculated according to the creator's influence, contribution level, and long-term performance consistency.</p>
            
            <p>This approach allows the system to prioritize not only content producers but also those who create sustainable and ongoing value for the ecosystem.</p>

            <p>The following formula represents this distribution mathematically:</p>

            <div>$$RevenueShare_{creator}(t) = \int_{t}^{t+T} \frac{(R_{total}(t) \cdot P_{creator}) \cdot (U_{creatorInfluence}(t) \cdot U_{content}(t))}{(S_{circ}(t) \cdot P_{ref}(t)) \cdot (1 - V_{creator}(t))} dt$$</div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>RevenueShare<sub>creator</sub>(t)</strong>: Total TIPS distribution to be made to the creator in period t</li>
                <li><strong>R<sub>total</sub>(t)</strong>: Total platform revenue in period t</li>
                <li><strong>P<sub>creator</sub></strong>: Percentage of total platform revenue allocated to creator program (e.g., 20%)</li>
                <li><strong>U<sub>creatorInfluence</sub>(t)</strong>: Creator's social influence score (followers, engagement, revenue contribution)</li>
                <li><strong>U<sub>content</sub>(t)</strong>: Creator's content production intensity and engagement received</li>
                <li><strong>S<sub>circ</sub>(t)</strong>: Total amount of TIPS in circulation during that period</li>
                <li><strong>P<sub>ref</sub>(t)</strong>: Reference TIPS price used during that period (0.75 · P<sub>instant</sub> + 0.25 · P<sub>avg</sub>)</li>
                <li><strong>V<sub>creator</sub>(t)</strong>: Vesting security ratio; what portion of tokens allocated to creator can be used in that period</li>
                <li><strong>T</strong>: Length of revenue sharing period (e.g., 1 week or 1 month)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Time-Weighted Score of Creator Performance</h4>
            
            <p>The influence of the creator can be calculated not by performance at a single moment, but by an average over time. This highlights consistent contribution, rewarding long-term value production rather than "one-off viral content." When distributing the creator's income, the decision can be made based on the average of the last 30 days, not just the last week. Regular contribution is rewarded rather than irregular but high volume contribution.</p>

            <div>$$U^{time}_{creatorInfluence} = \frac{1}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} U_{creatorInfluence}(t) dt$$</div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>T</strong>: Time period used for calculation (e.g., last 30 days)</li>
                <li><strong>U<sub>creatorInfluence</sub>(t)</strong>: Creator's influence score at time t</li>
            </ul>

            
            <h4>Dynamic Share Adjustment Based on Revenue Growth</h4>
            
            <p>If the total revenue of the platform increases, the percentage of the pool to be distributed can also be increased proportionally. This creates a loyalty mechanism that reflects the success of the platform directly to the user.</p>

            <div>$$P_{creator}(t) = P^{base}_{creator} + \delta \cdot \frac{dR_{total}(t)}{dt}$$</div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>P<sub>creator</sub>(t)</strong>: Creator pool share at time t</li>
                <li><strong>P<sup>base</sup><sub>creator</sub></strong>: Initial creator pool ratio (e.g., 20%)</li>
                <li><strong>δ</strong>: System sensitivity coefficient</li>
                <li><strong>dR<sub>total</sub>(t)/dt</strong>: Rate of change of total revenue over time</li>
            </ul>

            
            <p>As the platform grows, the creator share can be increased automatically. This directly reinforces performance + success commitment for creators.</p>
            
            <h4>NFT-Badge Point Multiplier Calculation</h4>
            
            <p>Each user earns various NFT-badges by completing different achievements on TIPBOX. However, not every badge is at the same difficulty level, the same sectoral weight or the same value. Therefore, it is not only important how many badges a user earns, but also which badges they earn.</p>
            
            <p>This model calculates users' NFT-badge collections as a weighted sum of points, taking into account the difficulty coefficient and industry importance of each badge.</p>
            
            <div>$$NFTScore_{user} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Rarity_i \cdot SectorWeight_i)$$</div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>n</strong>: Total number of NFT-badges owned by the user</li>
                <li><strong>Rarity<sub>i</sub></strong>: Difficulty and rarity coefficient of badge i (e.g., 1.0 easy, 2.0 medium, 3.0 hard, 4.0 very rare)</li>
                <li><strong>SectorWeight<sub>i</sub></strong>: Strategic importance of badge i's industry in the system (e.g., consumer electronics = 1.5, digital services = 1.2, cosmetics = 1.0)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This score highlights badge quality rather than badge number in prize pool distributions or prestige indicators. It also encourages users to choose more challenging missions and diversify their collection by earning achievements in new sectors. When necessary, the system can update these multipliers according to season, density or incentive targets.</p>
            
            <h4>NFT-Badges Aging and Decay Score</h4>
            
            <p>The older an NFT-badge is, the more likely its power to continuously benefit from the same pool may decrease over time. This reflects the principle of "permanent contribution, not permanent income".</p>
            
            <div>$$W_{rozet}(t) = e^{-\lambda t}$$</div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>t</strong>: Time elapsed since the badge was earned</li>
                <li><strong>λ</strong>: Decay coefficient of badge influence over time</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This score plays an important role in encouraging badge holders to constantly earn new badges. Content sustainability is kept at a high level by ensuring that the impact of old content naturally declines over time.</p>
