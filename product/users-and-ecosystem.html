            <h1>USERS AND ECOSYSTEM</h1>
            
            <p>TIPBOX has a multi-layered user structure and a strong, interaction-oriented community architecture. The platform is not limited to content sharing; it evolves into an ecosystem where users' expertise, trust relationships, and social values are integrated with economic benefits. This structure — where diverse user motivations intersect — creates a dynamic environment that enhances both content quality and sustainable engagement.</p>
            
            <h2>User Profiles</h2>
            
            <p>The TIPBOX ecosystem includes five key user segments, shaped by different levels of motivation and engagement:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Experience Sharers (Creators):</strong> Users who guide the community by sharing their product and service experiences, ideas, and recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact Leaders:</strong> Users who specialize in certain fields, are recognized by the community, and influence followers through their content.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactionists (Social Participants):</strong> Users who actively contribute to the platform's social dynamic through commenting and interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Seekers (Researchers):</strong> Users who aim to make informed purchasing decisions based on reliable and high-quality experience content.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Consumers (Passive Participants):</strong> Users who focus on accessing content and information, rather than actively sharing.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These user segments can evolve organically over time — for example, passive users may become active contributors or social participants as they engage more deeply with the platform.</p>
