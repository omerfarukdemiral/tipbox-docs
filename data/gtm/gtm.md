# GTM Model & Logic

Tipbox is not just about user acquisition; It is a network that aims to create sustainable interaction, value production and contribution culture. The Go-to-Market strategy developed in line with this goal is based on two basic models:

* Product-Led Growth (PLG)  
* Inbound Growth.

These two models are highly compatible with both the structural features of the platform and the digital behavior of the target segments.

## Product-Led Model

The Product-Led approach is based on the principle that the user experiences the product individually and receives the initial value directly from the product. Users on Tipbox:

* You can register without waiting for an invitation  
* They can add a product they own/experience to their inventory  
* Can share their experiences through this inventory item  
* Can navigate categorical areas of exploration  
* Can perform initial content production  
* You can gain motivation with the badge and inventory system

This entire experience process progresses with guidance within the product and gradually encourages the user to produce. This structure provides low-cost and sustainable user acquisition.

## Inbound Model

Inbound growth for Tipbox occurs when creators share their content on external platforms and that content attracts new users to the platform. In this strategy:

* Creators produce content directly on social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, X  
* This content could be a product experience, recommendation or social call.  
* Traffic is drawn to the platform through Tipbox references or redirects added to the content.  
* New users make first contact with the content through social media and then meet the product

### Creator-First Approach

In this GTM strategy, the Creator-First approach is positioned as the key content provider of Inbound dissemination. Well:

* Creator produces content  
* Shares its content within its own social media circles  
* This content makes potential users curious and attracts them to the platform  
* The incoming user gets the Tipbox experience → can turn into a content creator  
* This means new content and more inbound traffic

This chain forms the cycle of organic dissemination \+ in-product value creation.

### Model–Segment Matching Table

| GTM Modeli | Tipbox Segments | Why Compatible? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Product-Led** | Information Seekers (Researchers), Content Consumers (Passive Participants) | Thanks to its experience-oriented, guiding structure, you can easily discover the platform and benefit from content production. Provides a low-threshold experience for information access and content discovery. |
| **Inbound** | Experience Sharers (Creators), Impact Leaders | By sharing the content they produce on social media, they drive organic traffic to the platform. Users with visibility in specific areas can attract large audiences to the platform.  |

Unlike traditional distribution approaches, the Tipbox GTM strategy is a growth model built around in-product value creation and social content distribution. While the Product-Led structure integrates the user into the platform on its own, the Inbound approach provides the external force that draws users to the platform through creators' social media content.

### 

# Marketing Plan

## Creator Program

For Tipbox, creators are not only content producers but also strategic actors who initiate social interaction, build trust and transform user behavior. For this reason, the Creator Program has been designed as a key carrier component of the Go-to-Market strategy, both in terms of **user acquisition** and **the spread of contribution culture**.

### Contribution to Go To Market Strategy: Three Essential Roles

**1\. Organic Traffic Point That Starts User Flow**

Creators attract users directly to the platform by sharing their experiences on their social media channels. These contents are not just a promotion, but an example of the product content displayed on external channels. This way, users intuitively grasp Tipbox's value proposition before coming to the platform.

In the pre-launch phase of Tipbox, the content seeding process with a limited number of creators is the most strategic component of the first user traffic to the platform. The **10 creators** who will take part in this early phase will work under the direct guidance of the marketing team, and their content scenarios and platform entry flows will be managed through a pre-designed setup. Thus, the creator content will not only serve as a dissemination, but also as a controlled presentation of the product experience to the outside world.

**Estimated reach projection:**

* 10 creators x 1 content / week → **40 content / month**

* Average **1,200 views** / content → Approx. **48.000** social media display / **is**

* **5% referral rate** → Monthly approx. **2,400 potential user contacts**

This traffic is not just a quantitative reach; It refers to a high-potential user base with content-based motivation that has directly touched on Tipbox's product value proposition.

**2\. Communication Interface That Makes Meaning of the Product**

Tipbox's features such as experience slices, NFT badges, collection management and social storefront may be complex at first glance for traditional users. By explaining these features through their own use, creators translate the tangible value of the product to the outside world.

* Tipbox's "organize your own experience \- contribute \- be visible \- win awards" model within the product cycle can be visually tracked through creator profiles.

* In this way, the potential user understands how the in-product incentive system works through the content and the trust threshold is more easily exceeded.

**3\. Behavior Model Transformer**

As defined in the product document, Tipbox, unlike the classical comment system, builds a content culture based on "experience transfer". Transitioning to this culture requires a change in users' behavior in both production and participation.

* Creators serve as a reference for new users as early representatives of this new behavioral model.

* The rate of users who come to the platform with the creator effect to **start producing content within the first week is 25-30%.** This is a change in production behavior that directly supports the PLG model.

### Creator Seeding Model

In Tipbox's Go-to-Market strategy, creators are not only content producers, but also the first outward agents of product value. The creator seeding model is the first implementation step that enables the platform to go-to-market through content. This structure ensures that content production is shaped not only by volume, but also by directed meaning, thematic diversity and the capacity to provide intuitive transitions for the user.

The Seeding phase aims to create content chains prior to the product launch and the controlled dissemination of this content across social media channels. In this way, the value proposition of the platform is conveyed to the user through an off-platform contact; the first user flow is initiated in a content-driven manner.

**Basic Components of the Model**

The creator seeding process is carried out with the direct guidance of marketing and product teams, especially in the first phase. Creators:

* It is taken to the platform with one-to-one onboarding processes  
* Informed on production themes, content scripts and directional editing  
* Creates content that intuitively reveals product features based on the transfer of experience

The basic structure targeted in the seeding process is as follows:

| Component | Explanation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Number of Creators | 10 people (determined by considering segment representation and field diversity) |
| Content Frequency | 1 content per week (\~40 content / month in total) |
| Thematic Scope | Application culture, experience sharing, digital ownership, recommendation structure, social visibility |
| Channel Strategy | Controlled sharing on social platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, X |
| Routing Structure | In-content links and storefront redirection instead of direct CTA |
| User Impact | A group of users who get their first contact with the product from the content and experience a natural transition |

*Through this structure, creator content not only generates the volume of content, but also makes the product's logic of use, cultural structure and internal architecture of experience externally perceptible.* *Each piece of content does not represent a specific feature of the product, but a form of relationship with the product.* *The seeding phase thus serves as the first layer of strategic articulation, not only for marketing, but also for the real-world counterpart of the product.*

**Seeding's Role in GTM**

The creator seeding model, unlike classical user acquisition campaigns, is a growth tool that provides the first contact to the platform directly through content. This structure positions its two main effects in GTM strategy as follows:

**Inbound Trigger:** The content shared by creators on external media intuitively explains the value proposition of the product. Once the user comes into contact with the content, they switch to the platform and are encouraged to transform that experience into their own narrative.

**PLG Support:**  The user who comes through the seeding process is not just a content consumer; It is a participant with the potential to turn into a producer within the country. This behavioral transformation, combined with in-product incentive systems, supports GTM's production-centered growth model.

**Expected Impact and Continuation Scenario**

The main outcome of the creator seeding phase is that the contact that the platform will establish with the first users will be content-based. The purpose here is not to explain the product to the user; to keep the product alive through content and to create a cultural basis that will encourage domestic production.

A successful seeding model produces the following outputs:

* First user contact through content

* Making the platform value understandable and transferable to the outside world

* The user's tendency to be influenced by the content and turn into a producer within

* An initial user pool that is ready for the launch phase and has adopted the content culture

After seeding, performance evaluation will be based not only on reach data, but also on the rates at which the content creates interaction, provides guidance through the showcase and turns into in-platform production behavior.

**Revenue Model and Creator Advantages**

Tipbox positions creators not only as users who produce content, but also as strategic actors who carry the economic, social and cultural fabric of the platform. For this reason, the creator program goes beyond traditional content production incentives and is supported by privileges to generate direct revenue, build community through content, and become part of the platform's economy. Through this structure, creators become not only contributors, but also **independent actors incentivized by revenue in the platform's scalable growth strategy**.

**In terms of the GTM strategy, the revenue models provided to creators are not only considered as motivators, but also as structures that create sustainable content production and user engagement:**

| Revenue Model Component | Explanation |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Tip System**  | Receiving support directly from users with TIPS tokens; Economic response mechanism from the first production |
| **Custom Content Wall** | Creators can generate regular income by sharing some of their content only with supportive users. |
| **Community Group for Tippers:**  | Users who tip interact more closely by joining private groups run by creators. |
| **Community Participation Tip** | Passive income generation through the support provided by users participating in creator communities. |
| **Revenue Sharing Pool** | Prime Pass, cosmetics, transaction fees, etc. periodic distribution of platform revenues to creators based on performance. |

This structure encourages creators not only to produce, but also to stay on the platform, build community and increase user engagement. Within the GTM strategy, this structure both ensures the continuity of content chains and feeds the creator-driven growth model.

**Strategic Projection**

In the first phase of the creator economy, GTM aims to generate a total of 20,000+ monthly reach with an average of 2 content productions per month per creator and \~1,200 impressions per content. It is envisaged that 5% of these reaches will turn into economic interactions, starting a sustainable revenue cycle for creators at an early stage.

***Not:** Tipbox offers this revenue sharing structure only to users with creator status. This distinction increases content quality while making in-platform production sustainable with economic motivation.*

## Localization & Expansion

Tipbox is not optimized for a single country or user profile, with a modular structure that focuses on the user experience. The platform has been designed with a culturally sensitive architecture to cover differences in content production habits, perceptions of digital prestige, and the way recommendations are made.

Therefore, Tipbox's localization strategy and international expansion plan are based on the flexibility of the product architecture and user behavior analysis.

Our localization and expansion approach is shaped around two main axes:

* **Culture-sensitive localization of the product**

* **Systematic expansion strategy into new markets**

### Localization Strategy

**Module Level Customizability**

Tipbox's content experience is structured through structured modules.

Each module can be tailored to local user behavior:

* **Catalog and Discover:** In different countries, users may focus on different product categories, ranking systems and visual representations. These structures can be rearranged according to culture.

* **Wishbox:** The way of asking for suggestions can be modified according to regional social interaction habits.

* **Inventory:** The way users manage their experience history may involve different visual or structural preferences in different cultures.

**Cultural Flexibility in Content Formats**

* Content templates (for example, fields such as “who would you recommend it to?”, “where did you use it?”) may be structured differently from country to country.

**Onboarding and Training Content**

* The first catalogs shown to the user, badge samples, achievement tasks and contribution incentives can be set regionally.  
* Culturally appropriate community guidelines and content guidelines are provided for local users.

**Multilingual and Multi-Layered Content Management**

* The language infrastructure not only translates but also dynamically changes content components (module names, recommendation templates, category structures, etc.).

* Prestige tools like NFT badges can be localized with cultural symbolism.

# Expansion Strategy

**Selective Approach to Target Markets**

Tipbox's expansion strategy focuses on the European market in line with LAM (Local Addressable Market) targets. In this choice; High awareness of Web3, developed user suggestion culture and the suitability of the platform's modular architecture to these cultural structures play a decisive role.

Markets prioritized in the initial phase:

* **Türkiye (central market for LAM):** As a test market, product calibrations and system optimizations according to user habits were carried out here. It also has a user base with high community participation and a strong experience sharing culture.

* **Estonia:** One of the most mature markets for digital infrastructure and Web3 technologies in Europe. Users are early adopters and it is considered one of the most suitable pilot markets for Tipbox's NFT and token-based incentive structure.

* **Germany:** High adaptability to trust-based experience platforms; Users have a strong tendency to make decisions with structured data. Web3 awareness has improved. The intra-system trust approach can be tested through GDPR compliance.

* **Poland:** It is a rising digital user market that draws attention with its young population rate and mobile e-commerce volume. There is segmentation that favors experience-driven content contribution.

**Local Creator and Community-Based Expansion**

* Local creator onboarding processes are carried out in each market.  
* Bridge areas are structured integrated with local brands.  
* Wishbox is localized according to the cultural codes of social interaction and suggestion requests.  
* NFT badge builds are customized with country-specific prestige indicators.

**Diffusion Models and Partnership Strategy**

* The expansion process is driven by local creators, university-based micro-communities and content producer collectives.  
* Sustainable growth is aimed by positioning creative leaders \+ content editors in each market.

**Depth of Cultural Interaction**

* In Germany, content generation is more rational and based on trust verification, so catalog structures and recommendation tone are refined.  
* In Estonia, the badge system is integrated earlier due to innovative user profiles.  
* In Poland, mobile-based content production and a visually supported recommendation culture are encouraged.

## Web 3 Engagement

Web3 users represent a population that has higher digital awareness compared to classical internet users, adopts contribution-based systems, is interested in decentralized structures, and is willing to obtain economic or prestige value from content production.

While Tipbox includes this user segment in its target market strategy, it is not just a technological partnership; It is positioned on the basis of behavioral and cultural adaptation.

This section describes the activation and marketing strategies developed to attract the Web3 community to the platform.

**Position and Behavior Profile of the Web3 Community**

* Web3 users are predominantly located on traditional platforms as well as social protocol and content-centric networks such as Discord, Twitter/X, Farcaster, Lens, Mirror, Galxe, Zerion, Snapshot, Guild.xyz.  
* These users are particularly well aligned with products that include contribution-based reward systems, digital prestige, data ownership, NFT badges and participation points.  
* They are open to engaging with early adopters and structures that contribute to community growth.

**Marketing and Channel Strategy**

* **Cooperation with Partner Communities:** Creator campaigns are run through Web3 creator networks, DAO-like micro-collectives, creator-based launch platforms (e.g. Galxe, QuestN, Layer3).  
* **Seeding with Web3 Creator Program:** Collaboration is established with active creators in on-chain social networks such as Lens and Farcaster. Specific content tasks are defined for creators; NFT badges and TIPS rewards they earn become visible on their social profiles.  
* **Onboarding and UX for Web3:** Wallet connection is not mandatory for new Web3 users; the user can make their first interaction Web2-first. NFT badges are designed as social assets representing contribution history \- these badges are shared on Web3 profiles as a “visibility-enhancing prestige element”.  
* **Organic Impact on Social Channels:** The visibility of the platform is increased through badge shares on X, content in the discovery feed and social media comments by community members. “Access by reference” is triggered through the content of Web3 creators.

**Success Metrics for the Web3 Segment**

* Rate of traffic originating from Web3 from creator content  
* Number of NFT badges shared and claimed  
* Number of shares of TIPS and badge tagged content on social media platforms

Tipbox supports Web3 users not only by distributing tokens; It aims to transform it by associating it with content production, contribution prestige and digital identity. In this way, a meaningful connection is established for the Web3 audience at both the behavioral fit and value proposition level.

## Distribution Plan

Tipbox's distribution strategy is one of the most fundamental building blocks of its marketing plan.

The dissemination model ensures that not only the content but also the value proposition of the platform reaches target user segments. 

This strategy, based on the “Product-Led \+ Inbound” structure, targets organic growth through content, creator and segment matching rather than direct advertising investment. “Paid” advertising investment will be detailed in the following sections. 

**Organic Distribution Model**

**Content → Channel → Segment → Platform Login**

Tipbox contents; It is produced by creators, shared on social media platforms, and encountered by users in their natural discovery flow.

Each content contains unique links, reference codes or snippet components that direct the user to Tipbox.

In this flow:

* Creator content → spreads in dynamic media such as Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts

* Works with prestigious badge posts to the X and Reddit → Web3 community

* Medium & blog content → supports in-depth content narrative and SEO compatible strategy.

Creator content is as important as the platform itself; it represents the experience of the product, not its use.

In other words, the content is simultaneously advertising, testimonial and product content.

**Channel – Segment Matching**

| Channel | Target Segment | Distribution Format |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Instagram / TikTok**  | Interactors, Young users | Reels, Story, Experience Segments |
| **Youtube / Youtube Shorts** | Information Seekers, new users | Unboxing contents |
| **Twitter/X** | Web 3 users | NFT Badge achievement posts, contribution screenshots |
| **Reddit** | Information Seekers | Content comments, cross-community sharing of ideas |
| **Medium** | Impact leaders, Researchers | In-depth explanation, use case examples |

 **Tipbox-Specific Distribution Mechanisms**

#### **Creator Links & Reference Feed**

* Creators add unique reference links below their content.  
* Thanks to these links, content performance is measured and distribution resources are optimized.

#### **NFT Badge Prestige**

* **Users can share the badges they earn on platforms like X or Lens, spreading prestige**.  
* These badges serve as both social proof and viral distribution tools.

#### **Content Snippet Spread**

* Tipbox content is summarized in a specific format (snippet) and spread as micro content on social media.  
* Users are directed to Tipbox from these contents.

**Success Indicators**

* Traffic rate coming from creator content  
* Conversion rate per channel (clicks on content → comes to platform)  
* Percentage of referenced records

Tipbox envisions distribution not just as access, but as an economy of discovery based on content contribution. Each piece of content is not just a share, but an invitation, an experience suggestion and the beginning of a user journey. Creator-centered organic distribution has the potential to be both cost-effective and culturally engaging.

Segment / Channel based short-medium term distribution and marketing plan, organic and paid, will be shaped according to Tipbox roadmap and launch date agenda.

## Launch Plan

Tipbox's market expansion process is not just a technical publication; It has a launch strategy focused on behavioral testing, contribution measurement and gradual building of content culture.

This strategy; It aims to understand the cultural fit and growth potential of the product by testing different user segments, content production rhythms and incentive systems.

Accordingly, the launch process is divided into three main phases:

**Phase 0 \- Closed Beta, Phase 1 \- Open Beta, Phase 2 \- Launch**

Each phase serves a specific user segment and generates learning cycles around content, engagement and conversion.

The goal is to build a launch architecture that can be optimized for content quality, contribution rhythm, segment alignment and PMF signals.

### Phase 0: Closed Beta: **Creator Participation, System Testing and Building a Culture of Contribution**

Phase 0 is the pre-launch testing phase where Tipbox meets users for the first time in a controlled manner and is open only to the "Experience Sharers (Creators)" segment.

The aim at this stage is; to test additive quality, observe in-platform behavior, and validate the basic economic systems of the product.

Content production flow, NFT badge system, incentive structure and first PMF signals of product modules are monitored through creator contents.

**Purposes:**

* Testing creator content production flow.

* Observing the basic components of the product economy. (TIPS, Prime Pass, NFT Badge)

* Measuring funnel starting points and user behavior flows.

* Analyzing content quality and categorization efficiency through experience contribution.

**Micro Stages:**

**0.1 Creator Activation**

* One-to-one onboarding process is followed with creators.  
* Task-based content production takes place.  
* Contents are tagged with reference IDs.

**0.2 Product Economics Test**

* Creators earn badges as they create content.  
* Initial content production supported with Prime Pass incentive.  
* TIPS Token reward system is activated.

**0.3 Funnel Views**

* Metrics such as content creation time, production cycle, category hit are collected.  
* Creator-based content production depth is analyzed.

**0.4 PMF Signal Tracking**

* User contribution → badge → repeat contribution cycle is followed.  
* Spreading behaviors are observed through badge sharing and content chains.

**Success Criteria**

* Number of content per creator (x units / week)  
* Badge earning rate (above x%)  
* Category hit rate (%x+ (add content to correct category))  
* Average time spent on the platform. duration (x minutes+)  
* Re-contribution rate after production (%x+%)

***Note:** All of these metrics are dynamically optimized during Phase 0\. Exact target values are set based on early user behavior and content rhythms. In line with Tipbox's “measure-learn-adapt” principle, success thresholds in this phase are not fixed, but defined based on contribution quality and behavior patterns.*

### Phase 1: Open Beta: Creator Deployment, Content Consumption and Controlled Access

Phase 1 is a “trackable but inaccessible” deployment phase in which Tipbox opens its platform content to the outside world but limits user participation in a controlled manner. At this stage, users can view the content, but cannot register directly. When they request registration, they encounter a waitlist system.

This structure aims to both increase content consumption and encourage the dissemination of content on social media, while also creating a "desire to participate" in the user.

**Purposes:**

* Gaining initial user interest through creators' content.  
* Organizing segment-based user demand via waitlist.  
* Generating viral attention with an access restriction that creates a “want to participate”.  
* Testing the creator → content → user → access loop.  
* Creating the data basis for Phase 2 by collecting users' segmentation information.

**Micro Stages:**

**1.1 Creator Content Sharing**

* Creators share the content they produce on the platform on social media.  
* Each content contains a referral link, snippet or profile redirect.

**1.2 Discovery and Access Barrier to the Platform**

* Users come to the platform and can browse the content.  
* When they want to interact (comment, add to inventory, contribute), the registration page opens.

**1.3 Waitlist System ve Segmentation**

* The registration page redirects the user to a waitlist screen.  
* Segmentation information is received from the user (for: data-driven member acceptance)

**1.4 Routing and Segment Data Tracking**

* Creator → content → traffic → waitlist → data chain monitored.  
* This information is used in content distribution and funnel optimization for Phase 2\.

**Success Criteria:**

* Traffic from creator content (Measured by number of referrals per creator)  
* Number of users joining the Waitlist (Daily and weekly increase curve is followed)  
* Segmentation data accuracy (Self-reported interests vs. referral behavior)  
* Average viewing time per content (Depth of consumption analyzed)  
* Invitation chain trigger rate (Percentage of users sharing Waitlist)

***Note: I**n this phase, metrics are also dynamically evaluated. The success of “generating desire for access” is analyzed for the transition to Phase 2 through the spreading power, waitlist conversion rates and viral impact of the creator content.*

Phase 1 is a **"curiosity generation and conversion readiness** ” phase, where Tipbox is shown to the outside world for the first time, but is only allowed to observe. In this phase, the user recognizes the platform, connects to the content, but cannot be part of it.

This conscious tension lays the strategic groundwork for the access opening of Phase 2\.

### Phase 2: Launch: Mass Expansion and Viral Cycle

Phase 2 is the full launch process in which Tipbox is opened to the general user base, the waitlist system is closed and the platform is opened to all segments. At this stage, all product modules are activated and users can register, share content, create their inventory and participate in the platform economy.

The launch strategy is optimized based on user behavior and segmentation data obtained in previous phases.

**Purposes:**

* Creating an unlimited and scalable user environment open to the participation of all segments.  
* Integrating in-platform interaction chains (content → comment → contribution → reward → prestige) into a natural cycle.  
* Ensuring product economics (TIPS, Prime Pass, NFT Badge) work smoothly in mass scenarios  
* Observing whether catalog systems, Bridge areas, artificial intelligence activations and discovery algorithms produce value for the user.  
* Monitoring viral growth signals through referral systems, invite chains and contribution motivation.

**Micro Stages:**

**2.1 Closing Waitlist & Open Registration**

* Users can now register directly.  
* The registration onboarding screen is personalized with segment-based content and task recommendations and achievement ladders.

**2.2 Mainstreaming the Product Economy**

* All users can benefit from TIPS rewards.  
* Prime Pass purchase option and incentivized initial content production are available.  
* Badge system works automatically based on contribution history.

**2.3 Social Evidence Spread**

* Users are directed to share their badges and achievements on social media.  
* Social spread is encouraged with components such as NFT badge ownership, content snippets, collection view.

**2.4 Segment Based Engagement Cycle**

* Separate task flows and suggestion mechanisms are in place for each segment.  
* Participation → reward → prestige → repeat contribution → referral chain is established.

**Success Criteria:**

* Daily active user (DAU): Daily usage depth and segment diversity.  
* Non-creator user contribution rate: Start of organic content production.  
* Average content production per registration: Contribution rate in the first week after registration.  
* TIPS usage frequency and recovery rate: Sustainability of the economic system.  
* NFT badge share → referral: Conversion performance of social proof to viral impact.

***Not:** In this phase, measurements are evaluated not only with numbers but with behavior-oriented comments. The in-product conversion chain, the contribution model of user segments and the response to the incentive system are the main success criteria.*

Phase 2 is the breakthrough moment when Tipbox becomes a product that is “used, not just seen”. All product layers, economic systems and community engagement tools are integrated.

This is also the critical phase where the potential for viral spread will be observed in real time, revealing whether the value proposition resonates with the market.

# Sales & Pricing Strategy

Tipbox bases its revenue strategy on two basic approaches: **Value-Based Pricing** ve **Usage-Based Pricing**. While the privileged access and personalization features offered by the platform are priced according to the Value-Based model, the frequency of users' use of these features provides revenue generation based on the Usage-Based model. This two-way structure makes it possible to generate both fixed income based on the value perceived from the user and dynamic income depending on in-platform behavior.

**The Value-Based strategy** encompasses access tiers such as Prime Pass and Premium plans. Prime Pass unlocks in-platform transaction capability with one-time access, while Premium plans offer value-driven benefits such as visibility, personalization and social prestige. Pricing is based on users' perceived value of these tiers.

**Usage-Based strategy** works through unit actions within the platform. Users spend TIPS tokens for actions such as content promotion, NFT badge upgrades, recommendation requests, etc. This micro-spending model directly integrates contribution-oriented users into the economic cycle and ensures that revenues scale with user behavior. As users become more active on the platform, the **contribution → functionality → value → revenue** cycle kicks in. This structure both integrates individual contribution into the economic model and aligns user engagement with revenue, making the growth process sustainable.

Thanks to this hybrid structure, Tipbox both prices according to the value perceived by users and sustainably optimizes the revenue stream according to the level of use of this value.

Infographic 1

## Revenue Products Structure

Tipbox's revenue model is based on multiple parallel product structures targeting different user behaviors. **Each revenue item serves the forms of interaction that users have with the platform and the economic transformation of the value arising from these interactions.**

| Income Item | Payment Type | User Motivation | Contribution to the Platform |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Prime Pass** | one time | Making transactions, spending TIPS | Access to use Tipbox modules |
| **Premium Packages** | monthly subscription | Visibility, customization, analysis | Recurring revenue stream, user loyalty |
| **Token Spending** | Micropayment | Content support, social interaction | Engagement promotion, creative economy |
| **Creator Revenue Share** | Revenue sharing | Monetization, content production | High quality production, user permanence |

Creator revenue sharing is a structure where users who produce content can directly earn income. This structure creates a two-way value transfer by including not only content contribution but also content support behavior into the economic cycle of the platform. The platform earns a certain amount of income based on the volume resulting from this contribution.

Thanks to these structures working together, both contributing users and content consumers are integrated into the economic system of the platform. The non-overlapping but complementary nature of revenue products forms the basis of Tipbox's contribution-based sustainable growth strategy.

## 

## Product Pricing and Forecasting Assumptions

The price ranges were structured with a balance between increasing Tipbox's revenue generation potential while not limiting user access. The pricing process was based on the willingness to pay of user segments, the perceived value of product functions, the positioning of similar platforms and early growth strategies.

In addition, taking into account the targeted user volumes and conversion rates in the first year, prices were assessed to support both short-term revenue targets and the benefits of ease of access and motivation to initiate transactions **for Prime Pass and visibility, personalization and social prestige for Premium plans.**

| Strategic Pricing Table |  |  |
| ----- | :---- | :---- |
| **Product** | **Estimated Price Range** | **Final Price** |
| Prime Pass | 1.99 $ – 2.50 $ | *TBD* |
| Premium Lite | 6.99 $ – 8.99 $ | *TBD* |
| Premium Elite | 10.99 $ – 12.99 $ | *TBD* |

In Tipbox, the price of each product is based on its position within the platform economy and the depth of access it provides to the user, rather than the value the product provides.

The price ranges presented above are pre-launch strategic estimates; It will be optimized based on user behavior, segment analysis and A/B tests.

# User Behavior Flow and Conversion Expectations

Tipbox's user acquisition and contribution processes are modeled through a five-stage funnel structure in line with the platform model based on product-function structure and content economy. 

Each phase is structured by taking into account early growth targets, similar platform benchmarks, user interaction trends and first-year operational targets.

This structure includes not only the number of users; It is also based on the quality of behavior, content contribution intensity and levels of economic participation. Conversion rates are defined to be optimized in line with product positioning and incentive strategies.

**Infographic-2**

Funnel and conversion rates are modeled separately for each user segment and detailed with internal metrics. However, these forecast models and segment-based conversion data are not shared publicly due to company policies. The models in question will be offered to interested investors within the framework of a confidentiality agreement only in investment processes that have reached a certain maturity.

## Revenue Optimization

Tipbox uses its early-stage revenue growth strategies not only to increase the number of users; by deepening product usage motivations in certain segments **It is based on strengthening contribution-oriented income behaviors.** For this purpose, micro incentive structures integrated into the product architecture are applied in a targeted manner to specific user groups. Below are just some examples of these strategies:

**Special Badges for Consumer Electronics Enthusiasts:**

Users who share content about new products and receive the most contributions are offered badges and content highlighting privileges that increase their visibility in the category. These users are also included in the Premium Lite trial access periodically.

**Prime Pass Gift for Premium Plan Users:**

Prime Pass is assigned to the first 1,000 users who purchase one of the Premium plans in the early period in order to increase their in-platform interactions. This strategy both supports subscription conversion and activates token-based spending.

**Advantage of Standing Out with 'Trends':**

Various categories of fields such as Cosmetics and Consumer Electronics are periodically determined as 'Trends'. The content of users who ask questions/highlight posts in trending areas becomes more visible. These trending contents have advantages such as token recovery for the user.

This structure enables direct alignment of in-platform engagement strategies with segment-based user habits. There are many other similar strategies that increase contribution motivation, trigger payment behavior, and support both direct and indirect revenue streams in specific segments.

***Note:** In this section, only sample applications are included. The entire strategy set and detailed segment-based optimization scenarios are evaluated within the scope of internal strategic documentation and will be shared with investors upon request within the framework of the confidentiality policy.*

# KPI’s & Success Metrics

Tipbox's growth strategy is defined not only by user acquisition, but also by the quality of contribution behavior and the depth of economic interaction. In this context, the platform's success is tracked not only through numerical growth, but also through multi-layered performance indicators such as revenue generation per user, contribution continuity, content support volume and subscription conversions.

This section describes the key performance indicators (KPIs), value-per-user metrics (CLTV, ARPU, etc.) and the OKR structure based on strategic goals, each of which is structured in a way that is directly linked to the product functioning and revenue model.

## Metric Definitions

* **CLTV \= Favg × M**

   User's average monthly spending × average usage time (months)

* **ARPU \= Gtotal / Utotal**

   Total monthly revenue / total number of active users

* **ARPPU \= Gpayer / Upayer**

   Average revenue per revenue generating user

* **CAC \= Mmarketing / Uearned**

   Total marketing expenditure for new user acquisition / number of new users

## OKR Structure (Objectives & Key Results)

**Objective 1: Deepening user contribution and making content production sustainable.**

* The rate of contributing users should reach 40%.  
* 25% of users who made their first contribution must contribute again within 30 days.  
* At least 15% of producer users must be supported by the community at least once.

**Objective 2: Growing the revenue-generating user base and activating the economic cycle**

* 1,000 Prime Passes should be sold in the first phase.  
* The conversion rate from free users to Premium should increase to 7.5%.  
* Monthly token spending volume must exceed the $10,000 threshold.

**Objective 3: Increase long-term profitability by optimizing revenue generation per user**

* The CLTV average should rise above the $45 level.  
* The platform's overall ARPU must be a minimum of $2.5.  
* CAC value should not exceed 30% of CLTV.

All metrics in this section are predictive values prepared in line with the platform's early-stage strategy. Conversion rates, user contribution behavior and revenue generation models are projected based on product positioning, funnel structure and market entry strategies. The measurement systematic will be updated and maintained over time through testing, iteration and segment-based user analysis.
