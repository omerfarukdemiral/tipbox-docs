# **OVERVIEW**

Tipbox's financial strategy is designed to bring together the company's innovative business model, growth potential and investors' expectations in a professional and balanced manner. The company's financial road map is clearly defined, covering all critical areas from investment rounds to fund utilization, from partnership structure to exit strategies.

The financial statements presented have been prepared as of the Seed investment round, during which Tipbox will achieve a product capable of generating revenue and a solid user base. In this context, the funds obtained from the Pre-Seed investment round are used for the development of the product, preparations for market entry and building the initial user base. Therefore, financial projections begin only after the platform reaches a state where it can generate active income streams.

Tipbox attaches great importance to timing sensitivity in its investment strategy and does not take token-based investments unconsciously or uncontrollably. The platform does not conduct token sales; instead, they are only listed on reputable and highly liquid exchanges so that the tokens are accessible to users in interactions within the platform. This strategy ensures that investors are protected from speculative movements and that the TIPS token is traded in a stable and healthy market environment in the long term.

Additionally, the ecosystem fund has a high share in Tipbox's financial approach (40%). This fund is used to create strong incentive mechanisms and sustainable reward systems that center users. The ecosystem fund allows the platform to overcome the problem of early stage financial sustainability ("valley of death"), which is critical for startups, by being supported by resources derived from revenue models and mechanisms such as token buybacks. With this approach, Tipbox aims to create sustainable value for both users and investors, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial success.

The company's corporate financing begins with Pre-Seed, Seed and Seed Extension investment rounds, which support controlled growth from the initial stage, and then continues with a strong Series-A investment round. Thanks to the hybrid valuation method, both the advantages of the token economy and the stability and reliability provided by traditional capital investments create a unique and attractive value for investors.

Tipbox's partnership structure is built on a balanced share distribution, with strong representation of the founders and the core team. Dilutions that occur with new investor entries are managed with professional mechanisms such as preemptive rights to protect the shares of the founding partners and ensure investor confidence. In addition, share classes created for different investor profiles ensure transparency and managerial stability by clearly defining the rights and powers of investors in company management.

The capital obtained as a result of investment rounds is effectively managed to support the operational growth of the platform, accelerate user acquisition and strengthen its competitive advantage in the market. In this context, financial projections clearly show the company's transformation from the controlled investment and growth phase in the early years to a profitable and sustainable financial structure in the following periods.

Finally, Tipbox has determined professional and realistic exit strategies in order to maximize the value increase that its investors will obtain from their capital investments. Various exit methods such as IPO, strategic acquisition and secondary market sales are designed to be flexible enough to adapt to different expectations of investors and market conditions.

Tipbox aims to create a strong and sustainable financial future by blending company finance with professional management approaches, transparency and investor-oriented strategies.

# **CAP TABLE & OWNERSHIP ALLOCATIONS**

### **Founders & Shareholders**

Tipbox's partnership structure was created by the company's founders and core team. The names of the shareholders and the percentage of shares they hold since the establishment of the company are given below:

| Common Name | Ownership Rate (%) | Voting Rights (%) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Mihraç Cerrahoğlu | %25 | %25 |
| Burakkan Karaman | %25 | %25 |
| Ömer Faruk Demiral | %10 | %10 |
| Furkan Karabulut | %10 | %10 |
| Mehmet Koç | %10 | %10 |
| Aycan Karaman | %10 | %10 |
| Ozan Mutluoglu | %10 | %10 |

The company management has a voting and governance mechanism proportional to the shares held by shareholders. Each shareholder has voting rights equal to their shareholding and plays an active role in important processes such as strategic decisions, financial planning and management of the company.

Tipbox's co-founders are the permanent and immutable holders of tokens in the “Founders & Core Team” fund defined in tokeneconomics in proportion to their ownership of company shares. The distribution of these tokens is identical to their shareholding and is governed by a multisig smart contract created at the time of incorporation.

In case new investors join the company by buying shares, they also participate in the governance voting mechanism in proportion to their shareholding and have a direct say in the management of the company.

In addition, existing shareholders have a preemptive right and a right of first refusal in the event of new investor inflows. These rights ensure that the dilution of existing shareholders' shares takes place in a controlled and transparent manner and protect the rights of existing shareholders.

### 

### **Token and Equity Relationship Clarification**

The token (TIPS) created by Tipbox and the company shares are completely separate financial assets. Token ownership does not mean direct ownership of company shares and does not provide token holders with voting rights in company management. There is a fixed and direct relationship between company shares and token distribution only for the company's founding partners, there is no such relationship or conversion right for other investors. This allows token investors to evaluate the mechanism of obtaining financial returns within the token economy, while equity investors participate in managerial and strategic decision-making processes and also gain advantage in possible future exit strategies of the company.

### **Investment Agreements and Potential Equity Ownership**

Tipbox will evaluate the agreements to be made with investment institutions within the scope of Private (Angel), Pre-Seed, Seed and Seed Extension investment phases within the tokeneconomics structure, in case the investor parties request a shareholding in the company. As a result of this evaluation, it may be possible for investment institutions to become shareholders in the company, provided that it is appropriate for the management and strategic structure of the company.

In the event that these partnerships are realized, the proportion of shares to be held by the investor institutions and the dilution rate that this will create on the existing shareholders will vary according to the terms of the agreement. In addition, resources to be provided from the Bonding Reserve fund, which is designated to support the relevant investment phases or to be used for growth targets, may be considered within the scope of these agreements.

### **Team and Advisor Funds**

Tipbox does not issue traditional company stock options, except for strategically important deals. Instead, employees and consultants are incentivized through the company's native token, TIPS. The token incentives provided to employees and consultants are made from the following funds, depending on their role within the company and their area of expertise:

* Marketing Fund (For consultants and employees engaged in marketing activities)  
* Development Fund (For consultants and employees engaged in software and technical development activities)  
* Operations & Growth Fund (For consultants and employees who contribute to operational activities and growth strategies)

This incentive model is directly tied to the performance of the platform and ensures active participation of employees in the growth of the company. Details of token distributions, vesting and usage conditions are discussed comprehensively in the relevant "Tokenonomics & Distribution" section.

In addition, Tipbox reserves the right to become a partner of any natural or legal person invited to partnership by the company's founding partners, who can contribute to the company with intellectual, tangible or intangible resources, by providing equal dilution from the shares of the existing partners.

### 

### **Investor Relations and Token-Based Investments**

Tipbox did not have any institutional investors holding shares in the company at the time of incorporation. However, there is an Angel Investment and Crowdfunding Organization that made a 1% private investment during the first token allocation. This organization does not have the right to convert its token holdings into company shares in the future. Their investment is positioned as a token investment only and is not included in the traditional share structure of the company.

There may be differences between Tipbox's token and share ownership in terms of tax and legal obligations. Tax and legal obligations for token holders may vary depending on their country and jurisdiction. Investors are required to fulfill their responsibilities according to the current legislation in their countries.

### **Company Incorporation & Global Presence**

Tipbox has chosen Estonia as its headquarters to conduct its international operations and take advantage of global opportunities. Estonia was chosen due to its regulatory ease, transparency, reliability and strong legal infrastructure within the European Union, especially for blockchain and digital startups. In addition, Estonia's advanced e-residency and e-government systems that support digital business processes allow the company's global operations to be managed quickly and effectively.

In addition, Tipbox aims to facilitate access to potential markets in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, benefit from financial advantages and evaluate the flexibilities provided by the local regulatory environment. **Dubai** will open its branch. Dubai's status as a global financial center, its legal environment that supports innovative initiatives and its strategic location offering high accessibility will greatly contribute to strengthening the company's regional operations. The Dubai branch will play an active role in both carrying out operational activities and increasing local and international representation.

# 

# **SHARE CLASSES & RIGHTS**

Tipbox has created two main share groups in order to manage investment processes and clearly define the rights of investors in different investment rounds: **Common Shares** ve **Preferred Shares**.

### **Common Shares**

Common shares are created for the company's co-founders, core team members and, in limited cases, employees. This share group provides its holders with voting rights directly linked to their shareholding in company management. Partners have the right to participate in the strategic and managerial decisions of the company. Ordinary shareholders have a claim after privileged shareholders in case of dividend distribution and liquidation of the company.

### **Preferred Shares**

Preferred Shares is a group of shares created for institutional or individual investors within the scope of the company's investment rounds (Pre-Seed, Seed and Seed Extension). Preferred shares have special rights to protect investors. Among these; These include the right to receive priority payments in liquidation, priority in dividend distribution, veto rights on critical management decisions, and optional conversion to ordinary shares.

Tipbox may determine small differences in the Preferred Shares it creates according to investment rounds and expresses these differences clearly in the investment agreements. These differences are noted in the table below:

| Share Type | Suffrage | Liquidation Priority | Dividend Priority | Veto Rights | Conversion to Ordinary Shares |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Common Shares | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | \- |
| Preferred Shares | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (Optional) |

Preferred shareholders have veto rights on the company's strategic and financially critical decisions. These rights come into play especially in critical processes such as new investment round decisions, merger and acquisition transactions, sale or mortgage of company assets.

**Private (Angel) investors** are not considered Preferred Shares as they only invest in tokens instead of company shares and are therefore not included in the share classification.

Tipbox reserves the right to create new share classes and modify existing share classes prior to any future investment rounds (e.g. Series A and subsequent rounds) or major financial movements such as an initial public offering (IPO). This is intended to provide flexibility in the investment process in line with the growth of the company.

# 

# **INVESTMENT ROUNDS & DILUTION EFFECTS**

Tipbox's investment strategy is structured around three basic investment rounds: **Pre-Seed**, **Seed**, ve **Seed Extension**. Each of these investment rounds is planned to support the company's growth, increase its operational capacity and enable it to achieve its strategic goals.

Tipbox investment rounds are built on a special model where company valuation is done hybridly on both a traditional (equity-based) and token economy basis. For this reason, investors mainly invest in TIPS token allocation in return for their investments, and in addition, company shares are given as incentive bonuses.

**Planned Investment Tours and Targeted Investment Amounts:**

| Investment Round | Investment Amount (USD) | Token Allocation (%) | Equity Allocation  (%) | Hybrid Valuation (Min.) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Pre-Seed** | $600K | 4% | %3 – %5 | ≥ $15M |
| **Seed** | $1.8M | 6% | %7 – %13 | ≥ $25M |
| **Seed Extension** | $1.75M | 5% | %5 – %7 | ≥ $32.5M |
| **Total** | **$4.25M** | **14%** | **15% (min) \- 25% (max)** |  |

*(Company valuations are estimated in line with industry standards in both the traditional and web3 ecosystems and taking into account growth potential between investment rounds. These dilution rates may vary slightly depending on company valuation, investment amount and investor profile).*

The share-based dilution in Tipbox's investment rounds is more favorable than in traditional venture investment rounds and is at a level that preserves the control of the co-founders. The main reason for this is that in the hybrid valuation method, investors' main investment instrument is the TIPS token and shares are given as an additional incentive.

* **Pre-Seed:** In addition to token-focused investment purchases (4% tokens), share dilution is limited to 3% \- 5%, creating an attractive structure for early stage investors but balanced for founders.  
* **Seed:** In addition to the 6% token allocation, share dilution is capped at 7% – 13%. This rate provides a significant incentive to Seed investors while preserving long-term control of the platform's co-founders.  
* **Seed Extension:** By applying a maximum of 5% \- 7% equity dilution in addition to a 5% token allocation in the last investment round, long-term control of the company is maintained and sustainable advantages are offered to late-stage investors.

When all investment rounds were completed in total, the maximum dilution rate in company shares was kept around 25%, ensuring the influence and control of the founding partners over the company.

Thanks to this special hybrid investment approach, investors have the opportunity to benefit from Tipbox's high growth potential arising from the strong token economy while also gaining a share of the platform's long-term equity valuation. This structure creates a unique and attractive investment environment for all investors by revealing the company's true valuation in a clear and transparent manner.

* Strong value growth potential thanks to high-potential token economy

* Extra incentive for investors thanks to additional company shares given

* Co-founders retain control with low dilution

* Balanced investor-partner relationships for long-term sustainable growth

This hybrid approach clearly highlights Tipbox's comprehensive and professional investment strategy for both traditional investors and blockchain-based investors.

**Protection of Existing Partners (Preemptive Rights):** In order to protect the rights of existing partners, Tipbox adopts the preemptive rights mechanism in case new investors become partners of the company. This right provides existing partners with the opportunity to make priority purchases from newly issued shares according to the proportion of shares they own, thus preventing the uncontrolled dilution of partners' shares.

**Strategic and Private Investments:** Tipbox may receive additional investments from private or strategic investors in the future, apart from standard investment rounds. allocated to finance such investments. **Bonding Reserve** fund will be used. When such an investment occurs, share dilution and partnership rates will be specifically evaluated within the framework of the company value and management structure at the time the investment occurs.

Dilution rates in strategic investments made through the Bonding Reserve will be shaped in line with the priority purchase rights of existing shareholders and the strategic goals of the company, and if necessary, will be included in the shareholding structure through special agreements.

# **INVESTMENT PLAN**

Tipbox's investment strategy is built on a comprehensive and sustainable model that combines token-based investment rounds and traditional investment methods to suit the different development stages of the project.

### **Token-based Investment Rounds** 

Tipbox has identified three basic stages aimed at providing financing through token-based investments:

| Investment Tour | Targeted Investment Amount (USD) | Areas of Use |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Pre-Seed** | *600,000* | *Technical Development, Market Entry* |
| **Seed** | *1,800,000* | *Liquidity Management, Marketing, (If necessary: ​​Compliance)* |
| **Seed Extension** | *1,750,000* | *Advanced Marketing, Scaling & Growth*  |

### 

### **Token-based Investments’ Fund Utilization & Milestones** 

Management of the investments obtained through Tipbox's token-based investment rounds (Pre-Seed, Seed and Seed Extension) is critical to ensure the healthy growth of the project, strengthen its position in the market and reach the set milestones. In order to provide transparency and reliability for investors, the usage areas of the funds are clearly determined. The resources provided in each investment round will be directed in line with strategic goals such as developing the technical infrastructure of the platform, expanding user acquisition and marketing activities, creating sufficient liquidity and increasing operational capacities. With the determined milestones, the utilization processes of the investments have become transparent and traceable; Thus, investors can follow the progress of the project at which stages and in what time intervals. Thanks to this clarity and transparency, investors' trust in Tipbox is strengthened, while the successful achievement of project goals is supported through the correct management and effective use of funds. These funds from token-based investment rounds will enable Tipbox to grow sustainably and rapidly, giving it a stronger position in subsequent investment rounds (such as Series A & B).

| Pre-Seed (0-12 Months) | Seed (13-24 Months) | Seed Extension (25-36 Months) |

### **Traditional Investment Rounds & Utilization** 

Following the completion of the token-based investment rounds, Tipbox will conduct larger Series A and Series B investment rounds that will be funded through traditional investment instruments. These investment rounds will enable the platform to transform into a global player and provide the opportunity to evaluate larger-scale growth opportunities.

| Series-A Investment Round |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| **Targeted Investment Range:** | 5M \- 8M USD |
|  **Projected Company Valuation:** | 45M \- 75M USD |

The valuation in the Series A round was calculated based on the growth momentum of the Tipbox platform after the token investment rounds, the speed of user acquisition, the number of active users on the platform, the market performance of the token economy and the growth rates of the revenues generated. In the calculation of this valuation, a company valuation approach of 8x-12x times the current industry standard investment was adopted. The utilization areas and targets of the Series-A investment are as follows in general terms:

* **Advanced Product Scaling:** Adapting the technical capacity and infrastructure of the product to the growing user base and expanding the user value proposition by adding new features and modules.

* **Ecosystem Growth:** Strengthening the ecosystem with third party integrations, new business partnerships and strategic agreements.

* **International Expansion and Marketing Infrastructure:** Increasing the user base by entering international markets and expanding the marketing infrastructure on a global scale.

The milestone of this round of investment is to increase the platform's user base, revenues and operational capacity by 2-3 times.

Valuation of the Series B investment round will be made based on the growth rate and performance indicators realized after the Series A investment. In Series B valuation, a 2-4 times valuation increase is generally aimed compared to Series A valuation. Tipbox aims to achieve significant growth in factors such as the number of users, revenue stream and global recognition by achieving the expected growth rate following the Series A investment. This makes the projected valuation range for Series B realistic and achievable. The usage areas and targets of the Series-B investment are generally stated below:

* **Global Scaling:** Expanding existing international markets and gaining a strong position in new markets.

* **Infrastructure and Operational Expansion:** Establishing and expanding the technical and operational infrastructure to support high user volumes.

* **Strengthening Brand Value:** Supporting campaigns and initiatives that increase brand awareness and brand value on a global scale.

* **Large-Scale User Acquisition:** Widely increasing marketing and user acquisition activities and ensuring sustainable user growth on a global scale.

The milestones in this investment round are ensuring global brand awareness of the platform, gaining a permanent place in international markets and increasing revenues by 4-5 times.

Successful completion of these investment rounds will enable Tipbox to transform into a globally recognized, strong technology platform with a large user base and supported by sustainable revenue models. Both investment rounds are expected to have long-term, high value potential for investors.
