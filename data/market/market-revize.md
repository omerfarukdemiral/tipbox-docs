**Launch Adressable Market: Wide Social Network User Base Sharing Product and Service Experiences, Focused on Blockchain and NFT Technologies**

In its launch phase, Tipbox targets a market segment composed of individuals in **Türkiye and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)** who are interested in blockchain, NFTs, and digital asset technologies, who actively share their product and service experiences, and who are influenced by social references when making decisions.

This focused segment is estimated to include approximately **5 million active social network users** across Türkiye and CEE. Among them, around **35%** periodically produce experience and review content, while approximately **20%** share these contents on social media platforms, influencing the preferences of other users. The launch market is not limited to content creators; it also includes users motivated by **digital prestige**, **community visibility**, and **gaining social influence**. Tipbox aims to address this user group through its **verified content structure**, **categorical discovery experience**, and **user-centric reward mechanisms**.

Focusing on this audience during the launch phase will enable Tipbox to build an early and strong bond with users who have a high Web3 adoption rate and strong social interaction motivation, thereby accelerating the platform’s organic growth.

**LAM → Türkiye / CEE Launch Strategy**

Tipbox’s primary goal during the launch phase is to onboard, as early as possible, users who are highly interested in blockchain, NFT, and digital asset technologies, who have a strong habit of sharing product and service experiences, and who make decisions based on social references.

Accordingly, the launch strategy focuses on two regions where Web3 adoption is high, digital interaction practices are well-developed, and experience-sharing behavior is prevalent: **Türkiye and the CEE region**. Türkiye stands out globally in terms of **time spent on social media**, **cross-platform transitions**, and **digital content production**. Among Türkiye’s **62 million social media users**, approximately **35%** periodically produce experience and review content, while about **20%** socially disseminate this content or influence others’ purchasing decisions.In the CEE region, social media users are increasingly producing and sharing digital content, and a community-based decision-making culture is developing strongly.

User behaviors in these regions are directly aligned with Tipbox’s value propositions:

* **Verified content structure** addresses the need for trustworthy information.

* **Visibility of contributions** supports motivations for gaining social prestige.

* **Curated discovery experience** reduces content clutter and overload.

* **Systems rewarding social participation** foster higher user engagement.

The target user groups in Türkiye and the CEE region create a **two-sided value cycle**, consisting of both **creators** sharing experiences and **consumers** seeking social references during decision-making processes. 

Tipbox’s launch in these regions will enable the platform to build a strong early-stage social core by engaging with this high-potential user base. At the same time, it offers the opportunity to attract hybrid user profiles that blend Web2 and Web3 behaviors, fully aligning with Tipbox’s broader growth strategy.

*Tipbox, **in the beginning stages** It aims to provide the best experience to its users by focusing on three main sectors. **Cosmetic**, **consumer electronics** ve **digital products and services.** In these sectors, users are enabled to share their product and service experiences in these fields, make detailed reviews and access reliable information. These focus markets will help the platform grow quickly and attract a large user base. At the same time, the focus markets determined for the initial phase were determined in accordance with the Web3 policies (Mass Adaptation and Women in Blockchain) to which Tipbox attaches great importance.*
