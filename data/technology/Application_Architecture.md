## **Application Architecture (Web2 \- Web3)**

### **Architecture Overview**

The Tipbox application architecture is a fully integrated structure that encompasses the entire process from user interaction to data storage in the database. This design enables secure and efficient processing, management, and storage of user input through seamless coordination among components such as the User Interface (UI), Business Logic, and Data Management.

Access requests to the platform are handled by the API Gateway, which also manages user authentication and authorization. Upon successful authentication, requests are routed via a Load Balancer to the Frontend components. The Frontend includes multiple modules such as User Management, Reviews, Wishlists, and Practical Tips, each responsible for handling specific user operations. Data from the frontend is then transmitted to microservices, each performing a dedicated function.

On the backend, these microservices perform database operations through the API Gateway. Data is securely stored and retrieved as needed. This architecture optimizes the Tipbox user experience while maintaining high standards in data security and management. Processing and storing data generated from user interactions enhances the system’s scalability and performance.

The integrated structure of Tipbox ensures that users interact with the platform in a seamless and secure manner. Within this structure, the **Web3 Wallet Module** incorporates the benefits of blockchain technology into the user experience. This module, integrated with the mobile application, facilitates secure and transparent execution of digital asset operations across the platform—including NFT transactions, token management, and blockchain-based subscription mechanisms. The Web3 Wallet Module interacts with smart contracts based on requests coming through the API Gateway and processes the results in alignment with the rest of the system.

This architecture enables Tipbox to provide a reliable, efficient, and flexible platform for both users and business partners. Through the seamless integration of Web2 and Web3 components, users can directly benefit from the advantages of decentralized systems without encountering technical complexity.

## **AI Integration and Modular Architecture**

The platform’s **AI Agent** functions as an intelligent evaluator and summarizer, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to analyze user-generated content and produce insightful summaries about users and products.

The **Tipbox Validator AI**, a core component of the AI Agent, employs multiple fine-tuned large language models to evaluate content within various platform modules. This evaluation is guided by specific criteria (e.g., relevance, consistency, sentiment, and originality) to ensure a nuanced understanding of each input.

Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-quality content, the AI Agent can accurately detect poorly structured inputs. By utilizing advanced scoring systems, it assesses the quality of each piece of content and reflects this in its evaluation. This mechanism enhances both the trustworthiness of the platform and the overall user experience.

These capabilities of the AI Agent allow Tipbox to deliver a smarter, more informed, and trustworthy platform experience. Its modular architecture and AI integration ensure that the platform evolves continuously, offering adaptive and scalable solutions for both users and partners.

The AI infrastructure of the platform operates as a cohesive system within the AI Agent and includes modules such as the **Summarizer AI**, which delivers effective and reliable summaries about users and products.

* This infrastructure begins with the Preprocessing Module, which prepares raw content for analysis by cleaning and standardizing input data.  
* The Feature Extraction Module identifies and extracts key textual features from the input, forming the basis for deeper analysis.  
* The Evaluation Module conducts comprehensive analyses based on predefined criteria.  
* The Scoring Module assigns a detailed and holistic score to each piece of content, reflecting its overall quality and relevance.


Through the integration of these advanced modules, the AI Agent not only enhances decision-making processes for users but also establishes a robust foundation for seamless platform operations. This modular and dynamic approach continuously improves user experience while increasing the overall performance, trustworthiness, and scalability of the platform.

## **Account Abstraction**

In traditional blockchain systems, the requirement to sign transactions with private keys often complicates the user experience and increases security risks. The Tipbox Web3 Wallet Module addresses these challenges using **Account Abstraction** technology. This approach abstracts away the complexity of transactions and account management, allowing users to interact with Web3 features without needing technical knowledge.

Accounts are managed by flexible and user-friendly smart contracts, enabling a more secure and seamless experience. In addition to improving security and usability, the technology also offers an intuitive interface that streamlines interactions and increases efficiency. As a result, the Tipbox Web3 application facilitates the adoption of Web3 technologies, making them accessible to a broader audience.

On the Ethereum network, Account Abstraction introduces a more flexible account model that aims to transform how users and smart contracts interact. This aligns with Tipbox’s commitment to delivering secure and seamless user experiences by enhancing the usability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

#### **EIP-4337: Account Abstraction on Ethereum**

Introduced in March 2023, **EIP-4337** formally brought Account Abstraction to the Ethereum network. This innovation improves the user experience, strengthens security, and accelerates adoption of the Ethereum ecosystem by broader audiences.

By standardizing the use of smart contract wallets, Account Abstraction enables users to perform transactions more flexibly and securely. This opens the door to developing more complex yet user-friendly applications on Ethereum.

## **Web3 Wallet Module Architecture**

The Tipbox Web3 Wallet Module delivers the security and transparency of blockchain transactions within a structure fully integrated into the mobile Web2 application. This architecture makes digital asset management a natural part of the user experience, increasing accessibility while simplifying transaction flows.

The Web3 Wallet Module is built on a system that ensures synchronized operation across multiple components. Unlike traditional wallet connection flows, **user authentication** is handled through Account Abstraction, shielding users from complex Web3 requirements. Transactions are managed in the background via smart contracts, providing a secure and intuitive experience through simplified user-facing steps.

Core asset management components such as NFTs, token transfers, vesting mechanisms, and user wallets are managed directly within the Web3 Wallet Module. This architecture ensures that users retain full control over their digital assets, while functionalities like sending, trading, and marketplace interactions are executed through integrated wallet components.

Additionally, various digital service modules—such as subscription systems, exclusive badge slots, club memberships, and AI tools—are also embedded within this module. These components strengthen Tipbox’s value proposition and allow users to experience a personalized, tailored interaction. All these processes are automatically managed via smart contracts, ensuring high levels of security and transparency.

Thanks to the Web3 Wallet Module, Tipbox users can benefit from blockchain infrastructure without sacrificing the comfort of a traditional Web2 application. This system makes digital asset management intuitive while increasing in-platform engagement and enhancing the social experience for users.

## **Application Integrity**
