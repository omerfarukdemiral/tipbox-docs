            <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
            <p><span>Welcome to the hued, experienced and hard-working world of Tipbox.</span>
            </p>
            <p>Tipbox, which enables users to easily share their various experiences regarding products and services; and which builds a unique social network platform by bringing together the dynamics of the Web2 and Web3 worlds in the most accurate and rational way, is an exciting project that our team has been working on for quite a long time and is determined to bring to life.</p>
            <p>The platform we want to create allows users to share their experiences in an effective, reliable and verified way.  Our Web2-based and AI-powered application, the flagship of our platform, creates the perfect social media environment for users to share their experiences. At the same time, our decentralised application with Web3 technology, which is the new threshold of the future with artificial intelligence, provides a fast and reliable infrastructure for rewarding these experiences globally by providing token rewards with NFT-badges, which are evidence and ownership indicators based on users' success and experiences.</p>
            <p>One of the most important features that makes Tipbox unique for us is that it is designed according to customer experience sections and has a systematic structure that solves the difficulty of accessing information based on experiences, which is the biggest problem of some platforms today, and prevents complexity. With this platform, users can share their experiences about products and services in an effective, reliable and verified way. In short, Tipbox will create a new culture that offers its users the opportunity to achieve intellectual and tangible gains with an experience-driven interaction environment; while it will unlock to an approach that allows brands, entrepreneurs and their service providers in various fields (marketing companies, research and analysis companies, etc.) to create strong communities and improve customer relations and product strategies with verified information and experiences.</p>
            <p>As Tipbox, one of the things that make us strong is the great importance we attach to the current policies of the Web3 ecosystem and our close monitoring mechanism. The most important of these policies for Tipbox is the ‘Mass Adoption’ policy, which encourages the adoption of blockchain technology by the masses and its use in daily life. We are very excited that Tipbox's experience-driven social media structure allows everyone to easily share their product and service experiences in their daily lives and directly serves this policy.</p>
            <p>Our user interfaces are equipped with many innovative technologies such as Roll-up (Layer2) solutions and significantly eliminate many factors such as wallet private keys, high transaction fees, wallet integrations, etc., which are complex for new users of blockchain-based products and services. In this way, we aim to make a significant contribution to the adoption and increased use of blockchain technology. In addition, within the framework of the ‘Women in Blockchain and Crypto’ policy, we aim to increase the presence, activity and representation of women in the ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>In fact, according to the strategic roadmap designed in detail within the framework of the right growth model for the products and services to be offered by Tipbox, some of the consumer electronics, cosmetics, digital products and services sectors in the initial phase of the project will be in an attractive and attractive position in terms of experience sharing environment and rewarding for female users for products and services. As Tipbox grows, the sectors that are subject to platform content will increase; our users' earning by sharing their experiences in various fields will naturally expand our ecosystem by making them more loyal to the platform. In addition, Tipbox's B2B working model will be revealed more clearly after the user base is formed and will have a flexible structure in this regard. This flexibility will allow the platform to quickly adapt to the opportunities and market dynamics that will occur during the growth process.
            </p>
            <p>
