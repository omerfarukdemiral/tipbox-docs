            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>KYC and AML:</strong> Authentication processes are required for every user who registers on the platform.

            </ul>
            
            <p>By setting up its operations in Estonia, Tipbox benefits from the country's leading, transparent and reliable regulatory infrastructure in the European Union in the field of blockchain and crypto assets. Thanks to the <strong>"Virtual Currency Wallet Service"</strong> license provided by Estonia, Tipbox has the opportunity to offer its own wallet services. This licensing process takes approximately 60-90 days and can be completed at a cost of €15,000 - €25,000. Estonia's open and stable regulatory environment secures the platform's operations in the European market and provides significant legal and operational certainty for investors.</p>
            
            <p>Dubai is considered an important center for global finance and innovative technologies. Tipbox's Dubai-based operations were created specifically to benefit from the transparent and innovative regulatory framework provided by Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which regulates digital assets. The strong regulatory infrastructure, operational flexibility and rapid access to international markets in Dubai provide strategic advantages for Tipbox and reduce regulatory risks. This comprehensive ecosystem provided by Dubai reinforces investor confidence by supporting the platform's global growth targets.</p>
            
            <p>The selection of these regions significantly increases investor confidence by maximizing the platform's competence and compliance capacity in managing regulatory risks.</p>
