            <h1>Multi-Layered Architecture</h1>
            <p>Tipbox aims to deliver a secure, fast, and efficient experience to its users by leveraging a modern and scalable technology infrastructure. The platform is designed to create value for both users and business partners through innovative technologies. Tipbox functions as a platform that hosts multiple applications. A comprehensive software architecture has been developed to ensure the seamless and integrated operation of the platform and its applications.</p>
            
            <p>Tipbox is built on an architecture composed of three integrated layers, each designed to meet user needs at the highest level: <strong>X-Client, P-Core, and P-Data</strong>. These layers work in harmony to optimize user experience, manage background processes, and ensure data security.</p>
            
            <h3>X-Client (Xperience-Client) Layer:</h3>

            <p>This layer acts as a bridge between the system and the user, facilitating interaction within the application. It manages user interfaces and experiences to maximize engagement with the platform. Thanks to its user-friendly, modern design and high-performance infrastructure, users can easily navigate and explore the Tipbox platform. The X-Client layer ensures a seamless and consistent experience across mobile and web applications.</p>
                    
            <h3>P-Core (Prime-Core) Layer:</h3>
            
            <p>This layer is responsible for managing all backend operations to deliver fast and efficient services while handling user interactions. It automates business processes and processes user interactions in real time to deliver an uninterrupted experience. Built on a scalable architecture utilizing load balancing, microservices, and real-time processing techniques, the P-Core layer ensures sustainable performance even as the number of users and interaction intensity increases. Additionally, it continuously monitors and optimizes the platform's operations, guaranteeing the efficient functioning of the Tipbox ecosystem.</p>
            
            <h3>P-Data (Protected-Data) Layer:</h3>
            
            <p>This layer ensures the secure storage, processing, and accessibility of data by preserving the confidentiality and integrity of user information. Data is protected against unauthorized access through advanced encryption techniques and security protocols. Beyond ensuring data security, the P-Data layer also offers advanced data analytics and reporting services that provide valuable insights to users and brands. It utilizes optimized queries and caching mechanisms to enhance performance and enable fast data access. Furthermore, data management processes are designed in compliance with legal regulations and industry standards, delivering a sustainable infrastructure in terms of both scalability and accessibility.</p>
            
            <p>This architecture ensures the flawless operation of the Tipbox ecosystem. The synergistic interaction between the X-Client, P-Core, and P-Data layers guarantees high performance and data security, ensuring the user experience remains consistently top-tier. With its three-layered structure, Tipbox provides a reliable and efficient platform for both users and business partners.</p>
